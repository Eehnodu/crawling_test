Another Sunday afternoon
And I'm still in bed with you
Nothing else I wanna do, no
Order from that place you like (You like)
We don't need to go outside (Outside)
Something 'bout you feels so right (Feels so right)

Can we stay like this forever?

That we grow old together

Yeah, it's easy, baby
Oh, ooh-ooh
Think that I'm falling for you
Yeah, it's easy

I met you at the right time
See you and I'm still excited
Sittin' in that shirt of mine
A little big but I like it

Snacks in the late night
We don't need to do fine dining
Make love when the sunrise
Pillow talk in silence

Like this forever (Forever)
White dress or whatever
I keep dreaming there's a somewhere
That we grow old together
In a van or in a mansion
Raining but we're dancing
There's a billion people out there
I can't believe the chances

It's you
Loving's so easy to do (To do)
Yeah, it's easy, baby (Yeah)

Can recite every line
The pattern of the dress you wore
The color of your eyes
Everything just hits
All at once
Some things are worth chasing
If it’s what you want
Wont do this for nobody else
No
I’ll keep watch on what we built
I will
It never was perfect
But thats what we wanted
If one thing was certain
We took every moment
If this is the curtain
And it all comes crashing down
At least we had the world
in what we found
Play it in my head
And rewind it over
Say your name again
Just to feel you closer
Tell me what you want
And I’ll deliver
At least I’ll try my best
From the top of spring
and through the winter
I gave you everything
that I had left

We're in this thing together
I couldn't think of a better team
And when the world gets heavy
The weight has got you down on your knees
It's okay to say, ""F it""
If you just remember this melody

It goes
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
Ooh, ooh
It goes
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
Ooh, ooh
That's how it goes

When the cloud's above your head
And the sun's not breaking through
You know I'll be there to sing this song for you

And it goes
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la (Oh)
That's how it goes

La la la, la la la la la (That's how it goes)
La la la, la la la la la (That's how it goes)
La la la, la la la la la (That's how it goes)

Why do leaves grow and fall by autumn’s end?
Why do friends grow apart with no one to blame?
Why is it hard to change?

Why do flowers bloom only to die someday?
Why does snow become rain in May?
Why did I choose to run away?
You told me I should stay

Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Who knows if I’ll see you again
But for now I know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend

Why do roads cross only to part again?
Why do we leave so many things unsaid?
Why do we have to say farewell?
I guess only time will tell

Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Who knows if I’ll see you again
But for now we both know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend

Sometimes when I’m looking up at the moon
I’ll wonder if you see it, too
If you don’t forget me, I won’t forget you

Goodbye and godspeed my friend
I hope that I’ll see you again
But for now I know that this is the end

that feeling of when eyes meet
they said it would
feel so easy
like how a bird
takes to the trees
they've written the songs
and films and books
how it would take
just one timely look
to dance and fall your way
into love
and that's how you'll know
he's the one
it feels like way back when
i wish i had known it then
there's no such thing
as a soulmate
'cause love is what you make of it
i think i've got a taste of it
i wish i had known
all of this before
i wish i had known but at least
now i know
i thought summer vacation
would never end
that feeling of sinking
toes in the sand
they said to enjoy it
while you can
but those words
never seemed to land
it feels like way back when
i wish i had known it then
that time is the quickest
of thieves
she won't ever be caught by nobody
she'll run all the way to eternity
i wish i had known
all of this before
i wish i had known
but at least now i know
it feels like way back when
i wish i had known it then
that soon we'll be gone
with a final breath
and there won't be time
to hold onto regrets
but i know there's
something on the other end
i wish i had known
all of this before
i wish i had known
but at least now i know

This year flew by without a word
I had a plan to cross the world
But haven’t left this island

The stores closed down then opened up
I said I’d do a sober month
I failed, but tried, and wrote this drunk
In overwhelming silence

I’ll see my friends
When all this ends
But now until then

I’m holding out for spring
We can’t let winter win
That’s why I’m holding out for spring
Oh what a state we’re in
I’ll keep holding out for spring

Homework and cancelled holidays
The blame gets passed to save a face
The smell of last night’s takeaway
Just tells me I’m a mess

Still watching shows they recommend
That don’t get good until the end
I could be unwell, but then again
Maybe I’m just depressed

I’ll fix my head
When all this ends
But now until then

I’m holding out for spring
We can’t let winter win
That’s why I’m holding out for spring
Oh what a state we’re in
I’ll keep holding out for

Spring time
Blue skies
Frost fades slowly
Crossed my
Mind to linger

And hold out for spring
We can’t let winter win
That’s why I’m holding out for spring
Oh what a state we’re in

bike through town
Late at night,
cold feet and the air still warm
I ride through the passing
storms of my life
As before
It happens that I think of you
Of our days with silver linings
and summers in bloom
They always end so soon
Truth is, though our days are through
There's a part of me that's a part of you
What was colors and blues
Fade under layers of new
But I'm not sure if I want us to
Same scars but they're different now
They fade with the passing time
As they do, no need to fight
Cold hand and a burning home
You've seen some
of the rougher storms of my life
But that was before
I miss the times I spent with you
Our warm nights of stargazing
and summers in bloom
They always end so soon
But truth is, though
our days are through
There's a part of me that's a part of you
What was colors and blues
Fade under layers of new
But I'm not sure if I want it to

Love will come and go and it will stain
We were colors and blues
We'll be replaced with the new

Not sure if I want us to

어떻게 느껴야 할까요?
Hanging 'round these streets again?
이 거리들을 도로 떠돌면서
Close to someone else's chest
누군가 다른 이의 가슴에 가까워지며
Wanted it all but couldn't feel less
그 모두를 원했으나 덜 느낄 수는 없었어요
You swirled around my room
당신은 내 방을 맴돌았고
Like an everlasting ghost
마치 영원의 유령 같았죠
He's right here, but I'm alone
그는 바로 여기 있는데, 나는 혼자였어요
Morning breaks, I'm still in my clothes
아침의 휴식에, 난 여전히 내게 맞는 옷을 입어요
No, I don't
아니요, 그러지 않겠어요
Care about moving on, care about being alone
떠나는 것을 염려하고, 혼자가 될까 걱정하지 않겠어요
When everybody says I should let go
모두가 내가 떠나보내야 한다고 말할 때
I showed
난 보여줬어요
The way, it's all a lie that we used too much
그 방식은, 우리가 너무나 많이 사용했던 건 거짓이었음을
I'd do it again, but I can't
난 또다시 할 거예요, 그러나 그럴 수 없어요
I want it, I'm done, but I can't
난 원해요, 할 수 있는 데까진 했죠, 그러나 할 수 없어요
So, how is it supposed to feel?
그러니, 어떻게 느껴야 하는 건가요?
'Cause I don't feel a thing
왜냐하면 난 아무것도 느낄 수 없거든요
Other than the emptiness since you left
당신이 떠난 후의 그 공허함을 제외하고는요
So how is it supposed to feel?
그러니 어떻게 느껴야 할까요?
'Cause I don't want a thing
왜냐하면 난 아무것도 원하지 않으니까요
Other than the sound of your heartbeat next to mine
내 곁에서 뛰는 당신의 심장박동 소리를 빼곤 말이에요
When am I supposed to be
난 언제 이 모든 것을
Starting all over again?
다시 시작해야 하는 걸까요?
Teaching one to understand my bits and pieces
누군가에게 나의 조각과 틈새들을 이해하도록 가르치는 일을
How do you feel?
당신은 무엇을 느끼고 있나요?
You've won my sanity and all this insanity
당신은 나의 멀쩡한 정신과 이 모든 반대의 것을 가졌어요
And I want to hold on but I can't
그리고 난 견뎌 내고 싶지만 어려워요
I try to let go but I can't
난 놓으려 애쓰고 있지만 못하겠어요
So, how is it supposed to feel?
그러니까, 어떻게 감정을 느껴야 하죠?
'Cause I don't feel a thing
왜냐하면 난 아무것도 느끼지 못하거든요
Other than the emptiness since you left
당신이 떠난 후의 그 공허함을 제외하고는요
So how is it supposed to feel?

Would you like the way they smell
Never yes-es only maybes
For Calypso, I fell

She was so pretty
I couldn’t dare to look
We were sitting by the fire
kissing through the night
I said I’d catch you
if you fall down darling
I want to go back the day
we were there
But we were so battered
to the bone
And I miss the scent of you
when we’re in bed
So darling won’t you
hold your hands with me
So I couldn’t miss the days
when you fell into my arms
And I want to let this go
but we shouldn’t be this way
And I’m so glad you’d be right
by my side
So how’d it end this way
I want to go back the day
we were there
But we were so battered
to the bone
And I miss the scent of you
when we’re in bed
So darling won’t you
hold your hands with me
And I want to let it go
But you go out and
close it on me
slamming on the door
So I’m going to set you free
So darling won’t you go
I want to go back the day
we were there

And I miss the scent of you

you will never let go of my hand
You’re just too good to be true
and I feel so blessed
Made me wonder
if I was still dreaming in my bed
Smiled like a fool for a sec
and I made you laugh
Looking back from where we at now
weather changed
All I ever want from
you is just a simple thing
Always step the same
when we walk together
No matter when it rains snows
or the sun shines on us
Truly I would love you like I do

Stop for a minute bench
chilling be okay
Still got a lotta time we be never late
Looking at your eyes and
feel like I’m at paradise babe
Nothing feels better when you give me
that smiley face
All I ever want from
you is just a simple thing
Always step the same

No matter when it rains snows

I’m not gonna stay

I won’t meet you at our favourite cafe
Can’t believe we used to do that we were such a cliché
But now I’m not home
You’re deleted off my phone

You used to think that I would
Always be here waiting just for you
While you’d dance with her
To all my favourite tunes

Well I don’t miss you anymore
After days of crying on my floor
I’d love to pretend that we never met
Buddy you’re a lesson that I do regret
You’d just pretend
I was your girlfriend
But I was never yours to own
Whenever we’re together I’m alone
So maybe I’ll be better off walking the unknown

It’s quite funny that I see you on my instagram lives
Pretending you’re not there or that you’re stuck in disguise
It’s not fooling me
I wonder if your girlfriend sees

It’s sad you think you helped me launch up my career
but now you’re sat at home alone with just a bottle of beer
I made it on my own
No controlling undertones

You used to think that I would
Always be here waiting just for you
While you’d dance with her

Burns hotter than a five alarm fire

Has become a grand amour

Is there someone waiting on
for me
I dreamt of getting paid on time
I know I'm saying yes too easily
Love isn't always like lovin'
at first sight
So tell me Sheena
is it fun to stay
While your man's working
every time
Is it the fundamental thing
to say
'Cause everyone must
have a better way to shine
I could be on the magazine
next to Conan
Wouldn't it be fine
Oh I'm just a guy
No I'm just a guy
I'm just a guy works 9 to 5

Could it shine down here with you

’Cause my love is mine all mine
I love, my my mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine all mine all mine

My baby here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her

It’s a silky milk chocolate on a Sunday afternoon
It’s a little like a rocket on it’s way up to the moon
It’s a lot like you

Feels a little like the cool from a springtime breeze
It’s a little like the pool in the summertime heat
Kinda like a jacuzzi in the wintertime freeze
It’s a dream come true

Oh baby I love ya
More than you know
There’s no one above ya
Not even close
You are my sunshine wherever I go
I’m basking in the afterglow

Baby I need ya
All of the time
You make it look easy
Shining so bright
You’re melting my heart and you’re blowing my mind
This is what love feels like

It’s kinda like a conversation with your very best friend
Far beyond imagination it’s a little like zen
Sorta like a vacation but it’s never gonna end
It’s a lot like you (it’s a lot like you)
Oh it’s a lucky number 7
Its a favorite T Shirt
It can be so compelling
I don’t care if it hurts
It’s a little bit of heaven right here on earth
It’s a dream come true

Oh baby I love ya
More than you know
There’s no one above ya
Not even close
You are my sunshine wherever I go
I’m basking in the afterglow

Baby I need ya
All of the time
You make it look easy
Shining so bright
You’re melting my heart and you’re blowing my mind
This is what love feels like

Oh it feels like bliss
It likes pain
It feels like a walk down memory lane
It feels destiny
Feels like luck
It’s holding to somebody and never giving up

It’s saying I love you
As much as you can
Cause one of these days will be your last chance
If you get a taste, hold on with both hands
And do a little happy dance

‘Cause baby I need ya
All of the time
You make it look easy
Shining so bright
You’re melting my heart and you’re blowing my mind
This is what love feels like

I forget where we are
Where are we now
Come and define what are we doing
If you wanna start
hand me your rose
Oh babe
I’ll even love you
when flowers fall
I know our spring will come in joy
we’ll sing our song along oh babe
Where do we go
whenever it’s done
Anywhere sunlights on
Even in the rain we know
we’ll smile
Like any others do
We’ll dance until the noon
Until our worlds collapse
But I know we will survive
Oh babe
I’ll even love you
when flowers fall
Again our spring will come
In joy we’ll sing our song along
Even though when sun goes down
We will glow in dark

Is it to be or it is not to be
To fall in love again
to be the one for me
Sometimes you fall
but there'll be time
we'd be together
We'll be mad in every way

the store we went last september
Sometimes
recalling things would be so good

But I thought about you last night
First time in a long time
I really never cry over you and I
But I’m staring at the moon
Are you staring at it too?


I got a book of mental pictures
I look through sometimes but it hurts
Damn, I miss the days when you were mine
You can't turn back time, trust me I've tried


I know we, weren’t meant to be
But you left fingerprints on my memories
Yeah, I hope you're living your dream
And this life has become what you thought it'd be
But now and then I hope you're thinking of mе
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)


Swear, wish that I was there
Thе day you turned twenty-one
Did you spill a bottle with someone?
You said, ""This is for the best""
Maybe you were right 'bout that
Maybe you were wrong and we'll find a way back

Through gaps in the trees
We were nothing
but heroes with pain on our faces
And capes made from curtains or jeans
Dad said ask mum
Cause there was a party down
At Julias’s house
Yeah we were just 14, but 14 was cool
Like we both had it all figured out


I never thought that we’d say our goodbyes
Since you’ve been gone,
everything’s black and white
Like old photographs, we’d be frozen in time
And we promised to always be us
But forever was never enough

(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)



Bonfires at dark
Felt like it used to be
Us under the stars
But all of the ashes that we used to be
They all burnt to the ground from a spark

everything’s black and white

Why did you leave so soon
Promised that you’d be here
Thought it would be for good

It’s a silky milk chocolate on a Sunday afternoon
It’s a little like a rocket on it’s way up to the moon
It’s a lot like you

Feels a little like the cool from a springtime breeze
It’s a little like the pool in the summertime heat
Kinda like a jacuzzi in the wintertime freeze
It’s a dream come true

Oh baby I love ya
More than you know
There’s no one above ya
Not even close
You are my sunshine wherever I go
I’m basking in the afterglow

Baby I need ya
All of the time
You make it look easy
Shining so bright
You’re melting my heart and you’re blowing my mind
This is what love feels like

It’s kinda like a conversation with your very best friend
Far beyond imagination it’s a little like zen
Sorta like a vacation but it’s never gonna end
It’s a lot like you (it’s a lot like you)
Oh it’s a lucky number 7
Its a favorite T Shirt
It can be so compelling
I don’t care if it hurts
It’s a little bit of heaven right here on earth
It’s a dream come true

Oh baby I love ya
More than you know
There’s no one above ya
Not even close
You are my sunshine wherever I go
I’m basking in the afterglow

Baby I need ya
All of the time
You make it look easy
Shining so bright
You’re melting my heart and you’re blowing my mind
This is what love feels like

Oh it feels like bliss
It likes pain
It feels like a walk down memory lane
It feels destiny
Feels like luck
It’s holding to somebody and never giving up

It’s saying I love you
As much as you can
Cause one of these days will be your last chance
If you get a taste, hold on with both hands
And do a little happy dance

‘Cause baby I need ya
All of the time
You make it look easy
Shining so bright
You’re melting my heart and you’re blowing my mind
This is what love feels like

Pouring out my heart just
wasn't part of the plan

This love is for sure
And now I can open up without
feeling insecure
Never knew that we could
become more than just friends
I was out of luck
but you still gave me a chance
I won't go
Cus with you I'm home
When the flowers
are blooming girl
You just can't ignore
Suddenly
I'm not afraid to show
I'm taking the past
and letting it go
I'll make you believe
Just know that I wont
ever leave you rest assured
Cus I
I know that forever's
not enough
But I'll be your side
when time's get rough
My heart is all yours to keep
I'm yours for the taking
Cuz you're all I've been waiting for
Rest assured
Used to get all nervous
When I first held your hand
Little did I know
You'd turn me to a better man
Mi Amor
It's you I adore
And all of this time
I spent with you got me
wanting more
Can't believe I used to walk
around and pretend
Til you came around
and let me be who I am
There's no way
That I wouldn't stay
And girl you should know
that I still feel the same
Suddenly I'm not afraid to show

I used to write them for you daily

No one wants to hear a song
About the bitch that broke my heart
I should have listened to my mama
She saw through you from the start
But now we're here in Regent's Park
Amongst the flowers
and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun you look so lovely
That I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
That will make you change your mind
I'll say goodbye
on a beautiful spring day
There was a place not too
dissimilar to this one
Where I first saw your face
You look like home sat all alone
I should have found somebody
cheaper to chase
Tragically nobody told me
How expensive you would be
I lost more than money dear
You knocked the swagger out of me
But now we're here in Regent's Park

To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are!

You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby, amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much
And just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary

And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words

And whispered my darling you
You said the same thing too
On those beautiful moons ago

There's thunder in the skies
Teardrops are in my eyes
Because the dreams we dreamed
We're all just pretty lies
I know that faith's unkind
But never mind
To you, I will always cling
And memories will bring
Bring back those beautiful moons ago

And memories will bring
Bring back those beautiful moons

A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that everything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now listen, Jack...""

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa
Don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in diving
What's the use in jiving?

Cool down, papa
Don't you blow your top

[Verse 2]
The buzzard told the monkey you are choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
""Your story's so touching, but it sounds just like a lie.""

Straighten up and stay right

If I can't even give a warm touch
Maybe I am just
a little bit too much
But I could really use a warm hug
Mr. Snowman, come join me inside
I can turn on the AC,
I really don't mind
I can build us an igloo
of snow and ice

Sidewalk careless families laughing, others just one thing

If I got you here with me, then let it snow
You got nowhere to go

Verse 2
We wouldn't have to go outside
If the roads were closed, we couldn't drive
But if we wanted to, we could bundle up
And build a snowman just for fun
I'm not sayin' I don't love Christmas in the city
But if there was a way to keep you with me
I'd trade all the presents that I'll ever get
Just to hear the choir for a little bit

Chorus
I just want to be snowed in with you

Snowed in with you
We could spend the holidays
Just being lazy
Yeah, that's all I wanna do

If the man on the moon has lost his way
Then have no fear
They are somewhere near
They've just gone home for Christmas day

Homes keeping warm by firelight
Telling tales of Rudolf and his slay
There's tinsel on the ceiling
I've got a feeling
I think it must be Christmas today

It’s season for a miracle
I’ll keep on making a tree

Been an awful good girl

Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

And really that's not a lot

The deed
To a platinum mine

And checks
Sign your 'X' on the line

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany

Take a look in the five and ten
glistening once again
With candy canes
and silver lanes aglow

But the prettiest sight to see
is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hopalong boots
and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go
for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait
for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot
like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
one in the park as well,
It's sturdy kind that doesn't
mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot
like Christmas
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make
them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot

is the holly that will be
On your own front door
Show it's Christmas once a more

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to be spy

Drifted apart

If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

With yesterday's memory

didn’t mean to at the time
All the hurt I was feeling
in my heart it made me blind to you
What you’d been through
I paid no mind
Though I meant to and
All the fire I felt within my bones
became eclipsed
Just the the touch of your hands

So fast I almost missed it

I spilled another glass of wine
Killed the lights to pass the time

I still hope you read my letters
That they bring you peace at night
Even at our darkest hour
I know that we'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Makes no sense, I don't believe it
Is it true that thеy can just take you away
Walls were nеver made for freedom
And I'll break every single one to see your face

And I will hold the hourglass
Counting every grain of sand
'Cause nothing feels the same until you're home

That they bring you peace at night

I know that we'll be alright

The place I call home

Send out a prayer in my mind

I see two shadows up there

Happened so quickly I lost mysеlf
A shadow of you drifts along by my window

next to Conan
Wouldn't it be fine
Oh I'm just a guy works 9 to 5
Is there someone waiting on
for me
I dreamt of getting paid on time
I know I'm saying yes too easily
Love isn't always like lovin'
at first sight
So tell me Sheena
is it fun to stay
While your man's working
every time
Is it the fundamental thing
to say
'Cause everyone must
have a better way to shine
I could be on the magazine
next to Conan
Wouldn't it be fine
Oh I'm just a guy
No I'm just a guy
I'm just a guy works 9 to 5

in when we first began
Pouring out my heart just
wasn't part of the plan
But I know
This love is for sure
And now I can open up without
feeling insecure
Never knew that we could
become more than just friends
I was out of luck
but you still gave me a chance
I won't go
Cus with you I'm home
When the flowers
are blooming girl
You just can't ignore
Suddenly
I'm not afraid to show
I'm taking the past
and letting it go
I'll make you believe
Just know that I wont
ever leave you rest assured
Cus I
I know that forever's
not enough
But I'll be your side
when time's get rough
My heart is all yours to keep
I'm yours for the taking
Cuz you're all I've been waiting for
Rest assured
Used to get all nervous
When I first held your hand
Little did I know
You'd turn me to a better man
Mi Amor
It's you I adore
And all of this time
I spent with you got me
wanting more
Can't believe I used to walk
around and pretend
Til you came around
and let me be who I am
There's no way
That I wouldn't stay
And girl you should know
that I still feel the same

We’ve found some time
To be together
Just you and me
Caught up in life
Keeping up with Joneses
While you’re my priority
Take my hand
We can slow dance
don’t need music
And talk like it’s our first date
What a beautiful life we’ve made
I wouldn’t change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn’t take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Call me naive
a hopeless romantic
But I still think you’re fine
Before the bills the car
the house and the baby
Sugar you were all mine all mine
Take my hand
and we could revisit the place
Where we shared our first kiss
What a beautiful life we’ve made
I wouldn’t change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn’t take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Through the years
We have made so many memories
And I am still madly in love 3000
Way past the honeymoon but
Don’t care that we’ve grown up
You make our love feel brand new
What a beautiful life we’ve made
I wouldn’t change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn’t take a while
To stop and smile
And remember
What a beautiful life we’ve made
I wouldn’t change a thang

From staying or saying goodbyes

Right back to the valley of a bad rhyme

And stay high
High above the sky and fly But gravity
Sometimes it feels good
Sometimes it don't
Then at times, it's visible
Sometimes less shown
Gotta work this out no other way around
We're both grown
You and I, baby you and I

Darlin' take my hand
Realize we're on the same team
Try to understand that I'm not your enemy
Let's work it out
Give and take or
Agree to disagree cuz
This ain't the way love supposed to be

Just the other day, we were doin' fine
Even on a rainy day we had sunshine
But just like a hat, you snapped back
You changed your mind
Ooo boy, tell me why we gotta do this all the time
You say I got alot of fire Well you're cold as ice
If people only knew that you are not always nice
Bite your tongue,and watch your tone
Think before you speak cuz
You gotta know what this woman needs

Darlin' take my hand
Realize we're on the same team
Try to understand that I'm not your enemy
Let's work it out

This ain't the way love supposed to be

Cuz we know our love is not the same

Gotta meet in the middle

to shine brighter
when you walk by
As if it knows
that you've caught my eye
It's jealous
that you light up my life
And when the rain pours
in full force
It tries to ruin all our plans
But it can't
There's not much the world can do
To keep me away from you
I am committed to make sure

nothing can us stop us now

And colored of the fall
They boast of their beauty
But darlin' you surpass them all
I've been blessed
with the privilege
Of loving you babe
You're proof that God makes
no mistakes Oh no no
And O what a beautiful girl
He made

Nothing can stop us
nothing can stop
And when life
When life's an unstoppable force
And it tries to take us off course
We'll be immovable
And when dreams
As beautiful as they may seem
Ain't better than reality
Cuz baby we're better
There's not much
Not much the world can do
To keep me away from you
I am committed to make sure
These dreams we have come true
Gravity tries to push me down
There's no chance

nothing can us stop us now

Though they may try
Nothing can stop this love we have

I made the rules
Sang the songs
About love, or lack there of
Paint a picture

Past and future I'm so tired of writing your song
Kept away from the now but now she's here
The feelings loud and clear
I think I'm in love

Oh Vienna, Oh Vienna
Why you have to be so far away
Why you have to make me feel this way
It's been so hard on me
Here in Vienna
Can we make it work or leave it be
Never thought that I'd find love
In Vienna

See I've never been a fan of long distance relationships
Mainly cuz some people say it just won't work out
But baby let's break the myth, proving that we're strong enough
Cuz this just can't be summer love
See I've had enough
Of playin the same ol game
Nothing ever seems to change
But with you I feel something brand new
Can we take a chance on this
Or just cherish the days that we have left
What do we do baby What do we do

A chance on love see I fell in love

About anyone
I see her locking the door
So daintily she turns
and waves from afar
She makes her way
down the driveway
Smiling I lean over
open her door
I sit and wait 'til her
seatbelt's on
I hit the gas and we're gone
I tell her I've no idea
where we're going

long as I'm with you

I'll always answer your call

I'll always be prepared
Where ever you are love
I'll be there
Cause I'll go anywhere
and I'll do anything with you
She knows park
and it's not too far
Parking is free in the lot
She says she'd play here
when she was younger
I'm glad she shares
all her thoughts
'Cuz I'm not as social as most
but she helps me
Asking me all 'bout my past
I tell her I've never spoken
so freely
You made me better at that
We watch the sun as it sets
it's freezing
I offer my coat
she doesn't want it though
Hop in the car
and she cranks my heater

as I walk her to her door
She bites her lip
touches my face
smiles as she closes the door
We've never kissed believe me
there's no rush
I'd have waited forever
for that one touch
And I'd go anywhere

saying that we would never make it from the start

the name and the fame
You only saw my heart
You are the reason I'm inspired

Where would be if we had listened

On a napkin today
Didn't take me too long
Already knew what to say
But it would have clearly been wrong
Because it begged you to stay
So I threw it away
Threw it away
Because
Even though I'd love to keep you mine
My plan is not to change your mind
I'll lock the feelings deep inside
For another time
Even though I'd love to keep you mine
My plan is not to change your mind
I'll lock the feelings deep inside
For another time
For another time
Don't get me twisted
I admire everything
that you're doing
You have my best wishes
And I know that
you're gonna get through it
So girl if this something
that you're needing
To your feeling be true
You can only love me
as much as you love you
And girl I know you know
that's the truth yeah
Even though I'd love to keep you mine
My plan is not to change your mind
I'll lock the feelings deep inside
For another time
Even though I'd love to keep you mine
My plan is not to change your mind
I'll lock the feelings deep inside
For another time
I'm suppressing my fight
Cuz I know that you're right
Girl you gotta do what you gotta do
so you can be a better you
I'll put my questions on hold
And even though I feel cold
I'll be bold for you
And trust that I know my plan
Even though I'd love to keep you mine
My plan is not to change your mind
I'll lock the feelings deep inside
For another time
Even though I'd love to keep you mine

with the ocean
I shared a little whisper
with the stars
I wrote a letter
on a folded paper airplane
Hoping it would find a way
to your heart
It seems as miles
get longer every day
And the scent of your perfume
ain't as strong no
But every day away it gets
closer to the day we meet again
oh what a day oh what a day
Darling we belong
Distance only makes this love
twice as strong
Over and over again
I fall in love like the first time
Fly away with me
There's so much of the world
we have yet to see
No one can stand between us
it's just you and me
In love oh in love
In love
I've seen a thing or two
within this blessed lifetime
Never thought something
like this would come my way
But you came into my life
unexpectedly
You came from miles away
you came from the bay
It's funny what you find
when you come looking
I'm loving you just smackdab
in my face
Boy you have my heart
no matter how far
I'm dream away
so best believe one day
Darling we belong
Distance only makes this love
twice as strong
Over and over again
I fall in love like the first time
Fly away with me
There's so much of the world
we have yet to see
No one can stand between us
it's just you and me
In love
Oh you I must see the lightning
You turn everything so wonderful
Hope is when I've come and done
I couldn't see the sun
Your love keeps me still
And every moment
when I think of you my soul
feels so brand new
And the one I'd be longing for
I'd be longing for
Darling we belong
Distance only makes this love
twice as strong
Over and over again
I fall in love like the first time
Fly away with me
There's so much of the world
we have yet to see
No one can stand between us
it's just you and me
eternally forever
and always be
So in love in love in love in love
in love
Six thousand miles away
one day we could finally say
we've made it
Letter on a folded paper
airplane hoping it will find
it's way

Better than a seventh chord

Under a perfect line

Yes that's what you are
No one else comes close baby
You raise the bar yes you did
Even better than Lemonade
on a summer day
Oh yes I said it

Well better give you the credit

I've had writer's block since last October
Can I make through while staying sober?
It feels like I've been here before
Is it all the same?
Wondering why I came

[Verse 1]
Filled myself up on the local cold brew in the evening
Tryna stay up late and seeing if I catch a feeling
Took a drive, rolled the windows down to feel the breeze
Threw my notebooks out the window
'Cause those songs weren't good enough for me
No, those songs weren't good еnough for me

[Chorus]
Since that writer's block from last Octobеr
I met you and now I think it's over
Are you coming over one more time to know for sure
Or is it still gonna be the same?

[Verse 2]
One of us is gonna have to change or grow up
What's the point of growing if it only lasts for a month?
I don't know, but I promise I'm trying
I don't know, but I promise I'm trying

[Chorus]
I've had writer's block since last October
Didn't make it through, no, I'm not sober
I'm coming over one more time to know for sure
Tell me it's not gonna be the same

Is to tell myself

From the start
I never thought I'd say this before
But I don't wanna love you anymore

Is it still up on that shelf
It's the one I left on our bed
When you were out of town
Sick of staring up at the ceiling
How'd you change your mind
just like that
The only way to get past this feeling
Is to tell myself

wanna talk for a minute

that your heart's not really in it

place is crazy Crazy
And if I'm at the top
they're gonna hate me Hate me
Yo they stay mad
but we stay bein' us
Bein' us Bein' us
So if you ever think of walkin' out
If you ever think of walkin' out
Promise me
you'll stop and think about
Promise me you'll stop and think
All the nights I talked you down
when you get in your head
I cut the shit and put your first
since the day we met
And anyone anywhere
would kill for what we have
So when things get bad
remember
The way I know all the words
before they leave your mouth
And how your voice through
the phone's my favorite fuckin' sound
You'll never find someone else
to love you like I have
So when things get bad
remember that
Don't you dare give up on me
Remember that
Don't you dare give up on me
Remember that
Don't you dare give up on me
When things get bad
Don't you dare If things get bad
Don't you dare Remember that

And party with her cool friends
at the Chateau Marmont

To remind you why you came
Monterey to Camarillo
Camarillo to L.A
Driving with the headlights off
Ribbons running down your face
'Cause you've never known love like that
So you dance the night away
And the night bleeds into Sunday morning
And it feels like it's going your way
Then all the lights in the bar turn on
And you remember why you came

[Verse 2]
And suddenly you're sober
And you stay up for the sunrise like a songbird
Moonwalking like a creep
Just happy to, to be here at all
And suddenly you're older
Spinning the turnstile over and over
Who's gonna hold you while you sleep? Wеll
It's brave to be nothing to no one at all

[Bridge]
It's out of my hands
What can I tеll you?
I'm not losing it
I'm just having a laugh
Counting my paces
I'm making faces
At the one who stares at me
At the end of the glass

You take your evening outfit off
You run your shower and lean back your head
I love when you wash your hair

I hear you tell me lightly
You were quite a mess
But I worship you no less this way
You're quite the angel, Mary
As you cut up last night's dress
It lingers piece by piece this way

There’s nothing I would change, yeah
Passing all these memories, but I’m still just stuck on
You and me alone better than all the
pictures on my phone
How could I not give in, baby?
How could I ever say no?
Too good to be true, but we’re living our dream
Candle light on the roof, but we’re still in our jeans
It’s you and I (ah)
Dance in the good life (ah)
Dancing inside of our room
where we’re giving up sleep
Like Paris in June, but we’re just on our street
It’s you and I (ah)
Take in the view like (ah)
Dance in the good life
Are we both insane?
Dancing in the rain

All that lies I try to hide was so true
When the season come and go
I will coming after you
As the cloudiness the rain where it floats
Cause I
Wanna see the bloom
Why I was in the mood
Wanna feel the moon touching my body
Cause I,
Wanna see the bloom
Why I was in the mood
Wanna feel the moon touching my body

I like your ocean eyes
Blue like, Like my feelings inside
We could sinking down and down
Till we’re sober
You know my feelings well
And, honestly, I can’t hide
So we chilling, we chilling
Yeah I guess that’s it

break your heart into pieces
Got me waiting for the sun
Staring out ‘till morning comes
And I’ve been
watching the minutes
go ticking on by
And I made a wish
on every star in the sky
Hoping that these thoughts
I’m thinking are only in my head
It feels like tomorrow
just won’t ever come
Did I push you over the edge
to fall right out of love
I hope the thoughts
I’m thinking are only in my head
I prayed to the sky
I talked to the moon
Thought maybe they knew
something that maybe I didn’t
Did I say the words
a little too soon
Did I scare you
I think I might have

Let my arms be your cape.

The one from a year a ago
Across the ocean
where we supposed to be
Thought I’d walk
through the water
Through all the good
all the sorrow
We stand on the edge
of time tonight
The lies are gonna
make amends to be
Thought I’d walk
through the water
Things we had and the sorrow
But the wave on the shoulder
came up and washed it all
away from me
Put down your cards
just look me in the eyes
Let me in on your inside out
Just tell me what's weighing
in on your shoulder
If you had it so bad
So bad that you
turn your head away
Tonight its okay
won’t you let me know
You've been gone for so long
Like the sound of a color
Holding on your breath
and rushing away
Hey you
You’re like the sky in the water
A million different sunset away
from me

I just couldn’t sympathize
With cards on Valentine’s Day
And couples who say babe
I used to take my pride
In the way that I defied
All romantic conventions
And unrealistic expectations
I confess I’m lactose intolerant
And I might regret it
but I’ll take the hit
I’ll stay true to my feelings
And try romanticizing
‘Cause when it comes
to you and me
I don’t mind a little cheese
I love you to the moon
You’re a dream come true
You’re the bread to my butter
The shade to my summer
I wanna be together
I love you three thousand
More than the highest mountain
You’re the sun in my sky
The apple of my eye
All I want is you and I
I never thought I was sentimental
But I guess
I always had the potential
I think I had a feeling
from the start
When you became
the match to my spark
So even if you’re not in the mood
I’ll feed it to you
on a silver spoon
I hope it don’t
make you feel queasy
‘Cause I’m about
to get real cheesy
I confess I’m lactose intolerant
And I might regret it
but I’ll take the hit
I’ll stay true to my feelings
And try romanticizing

that this all happened

change is what you need
Expositions can't explain
the accidental situations
Congratulations maybe
this is what I need
I'm breaking patterns
I've been too caught up
taking care of you
but that's just who I am
I would have brought you
to the moon and to the stars
But if that means
I can not be myself
then I don't know
It's been a good run
but it's time to say goodbye
It's a roadblock thinking
I must move the cones
out of the way
So you can tell me
that I'm driving down
the wrong street
I'm so anxious
thinking past times are
the last tome were together
Can I see you in my sweater
one more time
I'm breaking patterns
I've been too caught up
taking care of you
but that's just who I am
I would have brought you
to the moon and to the stars
But if that means
I can not be myself
then I don't know
It's been a good run
but it's time to say goodbye
Even though I care for you
I think it's time
for something new
I'm ready for development
My feelings might be relevant
I tried to fix the puzzle
But we're stuck inside this bubble
And you know I'd try to pop it
But you'd probably try and stop it
And now I'm tired
of taking care of you
Cuz that's not all I am
I've so been torn
between what's right
versus heart
At least I had the pleasure
to become your old best friend
But as they say dear
all good things come to an end
I won't pretend I like it
and it's hard to comprehend
But as they say dear
all good things come to an end

There's beauty in nature and parables from kingdoms we knew
I'm not expecting much after, I'll make the most of my dues

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I believe He's just a story
And I'm looking for the truth
I have faith in my own journey
With those I love to help me through

[Chorus]
'Cause I know the world is a beautiful place
Too full of love to be alone
I know the world is a beautiful place
But we're on our own
We're on our own

And the ink has faded
I remember your hands
Would write it out in cursive
Every detail memorized
Can recite every line
The pattern of the dress you wore
The color of your eyes
Everything just hits
All at once
Some things are worth chasing
If it’s what you want
Wont do this for nobody else
No
I’ll keep watch on what we built
I will
It never was perfect
But thats what we wanted
If one thing was certain
We took every moment
If this is the curtain
And it all comes crashing down
At least we had the world
in what we found
Play it in my head
And rewind it over
Say your name again
Just to feel you closer
Tell me what you want
And I’ll deliver
At least I’ll try my best
From the top of spring
and through the winter
I gave you everything
that I had left
It never was perfect
But thats what we wanted
If one thing was certain

Wonder why it took you so long
To find a place
Where you belong
Not a day goes by
that you would redo
And the stars in the sky
All the water's in the oceans
Like the moon
You pulling me in
And I feel so damn lucky
To have you in my arms again
So won’t you stay
a little longer with me
It’s late out
How I love your company
So won’t you stay
a little longer with me
It’s late out
How I love your company
Mmm
Thank you Hope to see you soon

I love when you wash your hair

Verse 2
I hear you tell me lightly
You were quite a mess
But I worship you no less this way
You're quite the angel, Mary
As you cut up last night's dress
It lingers piece by piece this way

Pre-Chorus
You did some things that you forgot
Drinking wine and smoking pot
You tried to be someone you are not

Chorus
Now the morning sweeps you up
You take your evening outfit off
You run your bath and lean back your head
I love when you wash your hair
I love when you wash your hair

Our minds they play over
and over again
And I call myself a friend
While you call yourself a stranger
We float upon the hills
and on the grass
Speak words that
they will hear but
never understand
And I'm writing this in a bad way
No one can hear
what my head says
Oh no
take what you want from me
Because I can't bear it
I find it hard to breathe
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think about
it too much
If you ask if I'm fine
then I'd say yes
But I am lying through my teeth
and they all know that
I am flawed
I am flawed
Still you float upon
the hills and on the grass
Dreaming only of the time
that's soon to pass
And I'd say I just exist
in this darken world I live in
Oh no don't come near me
Because I can't bear it
I find it hard to breathe
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think about it too much
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think about it too much

I swear I'm fine
Cause I've been loving somebody new
It's picture-perfect, don't wanna lose it
I still feel you on my skin, but I'm with her tonight

She's everything that I've ever wanted
She makes me feel like I'm good enough
But every second that we're together
I still remember the way that you felt
But now that I'm with somebody different
Tell me why I'm still seeing you
Maybe I'm running
Fallin in love with
Somebody new
To feel how I did with you

I thought I'd sleep a little better if I'm not alone, but I was wrong
And I hate it isn't you that I've been driving home to
It's just not the same 'cause

At the foot of your bed when we swore on our lives
Thought I finally moved on, fell in love with someone

I wish you would tell me

Want you to show me

See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Midnight drives in your old
sweatshirts never felt so cold
And I still hear the stupid
songs you showed me
everywhere I go
I can taste the hesitation
running from your lips
I can feel it in my bones
they're breaking
We can't end like this

'Cause maybe I'm afraid to

Moments wrapped and romance
That end with bitter sunrises
and goodbyes
Moments so fragile and rare
That I wonder
if it would have the same taste
If not such a delicacy
But I'd still devour you
As I lay here and recall years
of wavering emotions
Suppressed desires
and volcanic explosions
That retreat into dormancy
I wonder could
we ever flow together
Or are we two twin souls
Finding each other
in the wrong lifetime
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
If I really love you

Tryna stay up late and seeing if I catch a feeling
Took a drive, rolled the windows down to feel the breeze
Threw my notebooks out the window

No, those songs weren't good еnough for me

Ooh, Ooh
Photos we have
They make us sad just come back
Like the flowers in spring
They all bloom when I sing
Only love that I bring
I'm yours in this reality
What more do you even want from me?
Unsure, tell me do you disagree?
My cure, baby
You're the only one that could save me
You're the only one that could save me
That could save me
That could save me
That could save
Three words
Can you say them right now?
Just those three words
Can you say them out loud?
It'll put my mind at ease
It'll help me fall asleep
Say I love you
I love you again
I love you again
It'll put my mind at ease
It'll help me fall asleep
Say I love you
Say I love you, oh
Yeah
Oh no no no

I’m pretty sure you already knew
And I am so confused
On why you’re acting the way you do


Look up to the sky
Asking the stars
If you’re the worth the fight
Because every night
Thoughts of you
Come to my mind


I’d never thought
I would be
Meeting you in all my dreams
And it felt so real
This is how I feel


Over the moon
When I see you
It makes me blue
Knowing that I can’t have
You
The one I swoon over

So spare us all the pain
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Close to someone else's chest
누군가 다른 이의 가슴에 가까워지며
Wanted it all but couldn't feel less
그 모두를 원했으나 덜 느낄 수는 없었어요
You swirled around my room
당신은 내 방을 맴돌았고
Like an everlasting ghost
마치 영원의 유령 같았죠
He's right here, but I'm alone
그는 바로 여기 있는데, 나는 혼자였어요
Morning breaks, I'm still in my clothes
아침의 휴식에, 난 여전히 내게 맞는 옷을 입어요
No, I don't
아니요, 그러지 않겠어요
Care about moving on, care about being alone
떠나는 것을 염려하고, 혼자가 될까 걱정하지 않겠어요
When everybody says I should let go
모두가 내가 떠나보내야 한다고 말할 때
I showed
난 보여줬어요
The way, it's all a lie that we used too much
그 방식은, 우리가 너무나 많이 사용했던 건 거짓이었음을
I'd do it again, but I can't
난 또다시 할 거예요, 그러나 그럴 수 없어요
I want it, I'm done, but I can't
난 원해요, 할 수 있는 데까진 했죠, 그러나 할 수 없어요
So, how is it supposed to feel?
그러니, 어떻게 느껴야 하는 건가요?
'Cause I don't feel a thing
왜냐하면 난 아무것도 느낄 수 없거든요
Other than the emptiness since you left
당신이 떠난 후의 그 공허함을 제외하고는요
So how is it supposed to feel?
그러니 어떻게 느껴야 할까요?
'Cause I don't want a thing
왜냐하면 난 아무것도 원하지 않으니까요
Other than the sound of your heartbeat next to mine
내 곁에서 뛰는 당신의 심장박동 소리를 빼곤 말이에요
When am I supposed to be
난 언제 이 모든 것을
Starting all over again?
다시 시작해야 하는 걸까요?
Teaching one to understand my bits and pieces
누군가에게 나의 조각과 틈새들을 이해하도록 가르치는 일을
How do you feel?
당신은 무엇을 느끼고 있나요?
You've won my sanity and all this insanity
당신은 나의 멀쩡한 정신과 이 모든 반대의 것을 가졌어요
And I want to hold on but I can't
그리고 난 견뎌 내고 싶지만 어려워요
I try to let go but I can't
난 놓으려 애쓰고 있지만 못하겠어요
So, how is it supposed to feel?
그러니까, 어떻게 감정을 느껴야 하죠?
'Cause I don't feel a thing
왜냐하면 난 아무것도 느끼지 못하거든요
Other than the emptiness since you left
당신이 떠난 후의 그 공허함을 제외하고는요
So how is it supposed to feel?
그러니 어떻게 느껴야 할까요?

All  the things I really feel about you
'Cause  lately time's been moving on
And every day we seem to grow a little older, too
The more I think of you the less I seem
To  know the way I feel about you
And  all I think is all I know
And all I know is all I want to think about is you

[Verse 2]
I  used to think I knew it all
And that the love you gave was mine for keeping
I guess I cared too much for you back then
To see the simple magic of it all
I  long to see the things we saw
When we were young and could not see so clearly
When all the world was just a blur of coloured lines
That I traced most sincerely back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you would say

[Chorus]
""Time to rest your weary head
Take your wings and go to bed
I know you wanna know it all, my darling""
And I'd say
""Set me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep""

[Verse 3]
I see the sparkle in your eyes
You say I'm beautiful and I believe you
And I will never feel more beautiful
Than when I'm wide awake beside you
I will wander far and wide and wonder
How it feels to fall in love with someone
Without the need to show her everything I've learned
About the world since you've been gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And you would say

[Chorus]
""Time to rest your weary head
Take your wings and go to bed
I know you want to show it all, my darling""
And I'd say
""Set me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep""

[Verse 4]
There was a time, it seemed the time itself
Was free and would go on forever
Wanted to cling to it but now I see
It's fading years its greatest treasure

[Pre-Chorus]
And you would say

[Chorus]
""Time to rest my weary head
Take my wings and go to bed
I know you want to feel it all, my darling""
And I'd say
""Set me down and rock me
Oh, set me down and rock me
Oh darling, set me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep""

Are all of the words that I wish you had said
You're so impatient asleep on my bed
Dreaming we'd left it and made love instead
But there's still some problems that I need to cure
So turn on the light babe let's find where it hurts
Cause is love to love you but I'm still unsure
And each time we fight babe we're only making it worse

Cause you know that I know that you know
That I gave you more than I should
I guess that means love
Ain't always so good

The floorboards are creaking the suns going down
You're watching me speaking but won't make a sound
I'm fighting this feeling that we're falling through
The less that you offer the more that I lose
So just throw me a bone babe and shoulder my pain
Why do we suffer to hide from our shame
When it's not like we'll live like this ever again
So come on now darling and try to just treat me the same

Cause I know that you know that I know
That I gave you more than I should
I guess that means love
Ain't always so good

You tried to be someone you are not

You take your evening outfit off
You run your shower and lean back your head
I love when you wash your hair

Verse 2
I hear you tell me lightly
You were quite a mess
But I worship you no less this way
You're quite the angel, Mary
As you cut up last night's dress
It lingers piece by piece this way

Still we both fought
Hard to keep on steady
No one’s ready
But we’re all we’ve got
Who knew love
Would find us here
Right on Castle Rock
Improvise
Cuz it’s what I do best
We only know so much
Oh I know you love to plan
Honey I understand
oh i hate when your stressed
This is new for both of us
I’m nervous
You’re perfect
We’re scratching the surface
Of forever
Of forever
Who knew love
Would find us here
Never would’ve thought
When waves got rough
And storms were near
Still we both fought
Hard to keep on steady
No one’s ready

You’re the only motivation
I‘ll ever need
Ooooh

Though everything keeps changing
We won’t be

No use in living in the past

Gonna make it alright

And she finds herself a smile
Recognize the little stars
Sparkling up her little sky
Summer evening in July
Every second so divine
Get a little lost in time
Staying up until sunrise
You gotta get up
Now I hold your hands in mine
As you walk here by my side
Watch you shine just like a star
I could do this all the time
Wishes on my Valentine
Always got you on my mind
Sweeter than a lullaby
Would you stay another while

Will your answer really change things, making me blue
I'm afraid some day you'll leave me, saying Can't we still be friends
If you go, you know you'll grieve me, all in life on you depends
Am I guessing that you love me, dreaming dreams of you in vain

What if he's the only one I'll ever miss
Maybe I should run, I'm only twenty-one
I don't even know who I want to become

I've lost all control of my heartbeat now
Got caught in a romance with him somehow
I still feel a shock through every bone
When I hear an “I love you”
Cause now I've got someone to lose



The first one to ever like me back

I will be beside you
And my heart will glide

into the traffic
The echo of your voice
is all I hear

With a breeze dancing at our feet
And we would
sing a song in harmony
If only you hadn't left me

Maybe then
I'll still be loving you

And we would get in fights
just to get over them
We would be alright

Or that my body becomes weak
Or that I can hardly move

Nothing ever really got to me
I could always turn
the other cheek
Could it be those days are gone
I could have sworn
that I was strong
Well at least stronger
than these emotions
that are taking over me
I swear I'm stronger
than these emotions
but they're taking over me
No no no this can't be it
Unless you are unless she is
Well no no no

It's just I wasn't ready for these

You're the silence
in a roaring crowd
You're the equivalent
of a fluffy cloud
A genie in a bottle
make a wish to wish
the wishes would never end
And they never end
You're the platinum
in my treasure chest
You're the answer
that I never would have guessed
on my love life test
And I don't mind at all
I don't mind at all

You took it for your land
You got a use for every stream and tree
When I go up the highway
old trees are dying up that way
You pump out the water
and sell it back to me
You build mansions in the city
prisons in Mojave
Bet you`re quite a pillar of high society
You call it law and order
I call it dirty money
You lock the young ones
down or send `em off to war
No hard feelings no offense taken
You`re just a ripple in the shifting
sands of time
No bad karma no curses on ya
You go your way I`ll go mine
You remind me of a fellow
I heard of in the city
Nervous kind of fellow
he loved money like you do
He derived no satisfaction so
he jumped clear out the window
They tell me that
he bounced a time or two
So take in mind the credo
of a jackass prospector
Take what you need
but please leave the rest alone
Try and live harmonie
with old Mother Nature
You`ll remain in grace
after you have gone
Don`t get many callers
that little road leads nowhere
Been here 40 years seems like yesterday
There`s an aId screech owl
living in my chimney
I don `t build no fires
he keeps the mice away
No hard feelings na offense taken
You`re just a murmur in the whispering
sands of time
No bad karma na curses on ya
You go your way I`ll go mine

Digging through the couch
for my car keys
Looking for the door
but I can't leave
Could someone pull me out of this daydream?

I know every moment is a new chance
To find somebody real enough
to slow dance till the morning
If that's what we
That's what we do

And see the fire light

The star is shining bright
I swear I can hear the angels sing
But can't seem to take it in
Until I go back

Guess it's truly no place like home
Truly no place like home
Santa's giving hugs out in the cold
Children singing carols
to whom they love
I do what I can
I got my mama on the phone

Spend our days under snow white duvets

get high at the Louvre
Talk through the night and
sleep in 'til noon
Let's scratch our names
on the church walls and bells
Empty our pockets on all-black Chanel

Listening every day so I got to stay humble

of where we’re at
Wish I could have said
what I'm saying now
Should have played it first
but for what it's worth
I’m sorry that I let us down again
I never meant to break your heart
Tear us apart like this
Oh I just wish that I could go
Back to back then
Back when we were more than friends
More than friends
Now we pause at the end of
phone calls
'Cause neither of us knows
how to say goodbye
Tell our friends we're better off
But everything I feel says that's a lie
Wish I could have said
what I'm saying now
Should have played it first
but for what it's worth
I'm sorry that I let us down again

Tear us apart like this

that you wanna be alone
I could hear the distance
in your voice over the phone
You don't say I love you back
Or let your feelings show
You used to be so good at that
But now I never know
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me
how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Midnight drives in your old
sweatshirts never felt so cold
And I still hear the stupid
songs you showed me
everywhere I go
I can taste the hesitation
running from your lips
I can feel it in my bones
they're breaking
We can't end like this
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me
how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Moments wrapped and romance
That end with bitter sunrises
and goodbyes
Moments so fragile and rare
That I wonder
if it would have the same taste
If not such a delicacy
But I'd still devour you
As I lay here and recall years
of wavering emotions
Suppressed desires
and volcanic explosions
That retreat into dormancy
I wonder could
we ever flow together
Or are we two twin souls
Finding each other
in the wrong lifetime
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
If I really love you
I'll let you go

on the clothes of love

Spend hours lyin in vibes
And we ride it till the morning

Crashin on me when we lay
Changin up my ways ways
So quick to leave now I stay
Can't see the surface no more
Far from the shore
Swimmin in your waters for more
You hit like a wave wave
Crashin on me when we lay
I can feel the sun rising
It's painting our bodies
in orange and gold

How good things have a bad side
You spend your time waiting around
For the fall not the goodbye
When you're naive and so green
It makes it hard to believe
How life works when you're older

Could be from life or love or I don't know why
It's all out of our hands, nobody will ever understand
Don't blame yourself and don't ask why
That's the art of getting by
That's the art of getting by
It gets easy to become blind to
The good things when times are rough
But when there's nothing left to try and do
It's okay to throw your hands up
'Cause there's no use in getting burned
From the same lessons that you learned
So carry them with you and be wiser
Even the best of us get hurt sometimes
Could be from life or love or I don't know why
It's all out of our hands, nobody will ever understand
Don't blame yourself and don't ask why
That's the art of getting by
That's the art of getting by
No life ain't a game
There's nothing to win, and no way to cheat
We all walk through flames
All get burned from the heat

dissimilar to this one
Where I first saw your face
You look like home sat all alone

cheaper to chase

Driving till my eyes give up
Headlights
To your apartment
This ride
I done it 'bout a thousand times
But it doesn't feel right
Here without you

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes me back to windows down in ocean air
Sunset eyes through messy hair
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights

I know that it's over
But it's haunting me
Like a ghost of the summer
I still see

[Chorus]
Midnight drives and summer skin
The taste of liquor on your lips
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights

[Verse 2]
Face up
Watching all the streetlights turn
To shadows
In my apartment
Ten months
I swear, I should be fine by now
But it still gives me a head rush
When I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes me back to
Rooftop, moonlight, silhouettes
Purple skies and cigarettes
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights

I know that it's over
But it's haunting me
Like a ghost of the summer
I still see

[Chorus]
Midnight trudging, summer skin
The taste of liquor on your lips
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights
All those sleepless nights

(I know that it's over
Like a ghost of the summer)

A starry drive in mid july
Park the car turn off the lights
And venture through a field out
on our own
The birds they sang a melody
My heart was keeping time and we
Were dancing on the edge
of something new
Slow at first but still it seems
That we'll go down in history
As lovers from the start
just me and you
I've spent a thousand nights
Lost in your emerald eyes
Lost in a place where I know
you can see my soul
Make me lose track of time
You and your emerald eyes
Finally found a place that
I can call my home
A subtle breeze it's you and me
Chest to chest no in between
And every moment's
better than the last
Anything and everything
That I could ever want and need
Is standing right beside me
in the grass

We were love drunk waiting

Trying to find ourselves

So alone in love like the world

Oh I won’t be silent
and I won’t let go
I will hold on
tighter ‘til the afterglow
And we’ll burn so bright ‘til

Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow

The leaves are buried
under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine

This is a level where
we’re losing track of time

with a new sense of being

couldn't change my mind
Since you let me

How it feels to love
Some kinda love
Dumped out my cigarettes
it's now time to second guess
Every time I've given up
Cuz I played so much pretend
I've always wondered when
I would forget who I was
Now my flaws don't make me bad
and jealousy don't make me
wanna quit

The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart

Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least for most
of the questions in my heart
Like Why are we here
and Where do we go
And How come it's so hard
It's not always easy
and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together
Mmm it's always better
when we're together
Yeah we'll look at the stars
when we're together
Well it's always better
when we're together
Yeah it's always better
when we're together
And all of these moments
just may find their way
Into of my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
and brings new things
For tomorrow night you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of the dreams might find a way
Into my dad to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two just me and you
Now so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sip and eat the mango tree now
Yeah it's always better
when we're together
Mmm somewhere in-between together
Well it's always better
when we're together
Yeah it's always better
when we're together
I believe in memories
They look so so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
There is no no song I could sing
And there is no combination
of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together

I'm not the type to spend a late night with a stranger
But it happened to be you

Got my friends back at the bar
Think they probably stole my card
But what else is there to do

Said you
Got a place by the beach
With a few friends
Just an hour away
As we were leaving

Move the mess to the back
To clear the seats
And now it's just me and you

[Chorus x2]
And we
We got a lot in common suddenly
We're looking at the sun
I'll spend the night with you
And I'll be rеal with you
I never fall in love with strangеrs

[Verse 2]
Said you wanna be a model
Write a novel
Take a second shot at college
Gain some knowledge

Really wanna make some dollars
Be a scholar
Got your life in front of you

Tryna be somebody
Not just anybody
Got a pocket full of dreams
Nobody stopping

I should be heading home
But something's got me locked
Right onto you

[Chorus x2]
And we
We got a lot in common suddenly
We're looking at the sun
I'll spend the night with you
And I'll be real with you
I never fall in love with strangers

I'm glad she shares
all her thoughts
'Cuz I'm not as social as most

I tell her I've never spoken
so freely
You made me better at that

touches my face
smiles as she closes the door

I've forgotten you, just like I should,
of course I have
Except to hear your name,
or someone's laugh that is the same.
But I've forgotten you just like I should.

What a guy! What a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon.
What's in store? Should I 'phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune.

Except perhaps in spring,
but I should never think of spring,
For that would surely break my heart in two.

to give up you

ever mattered to me
like you do
'Cause you're so up here
I caught that feeling
And touch the ceiling ooh
I wish I could describe it
with words to say not enough
And nothing that I could ever
say would measure up
But what I can't stand is
you're under my hands
And up outta the world ooh

From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work

Three doors down so you can't ignore it
I'll hunt you down like a tyrannosaurus
My teeth are sharp like the great white shark
Let me taste that flesh, it's my favourite part
Gotta eat, gold beak, with the ostrich feet
7 spider eyes for every day of the week
Means I'm still up working while your bitch ass sleeps
I'm an alien among the human beings

Verse 2
Ten doors down but you still can't see me
I talk a lot of shit so you won't believe me
I really wouldn't say anything else
I shouldn't be standing here all by myself
Cause I'm out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own
I told you I was out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own

Breed of roses that were redder
Than the A upon the bosom

and would appreciate 'em better
And would toss another bud
upon hearing the word whatever
It’s your favorite
I know it
'cause you said it enough
We was in it to Uh
But came out it in love
It’s a gift from above
It’s the curse of the dove
Fall in love and you can follow it
to something that’s rough but say
I got a knack for bein' too
into the world around me
That’s probably
why you never trust me
when there’s girls around me
You know I never
lift a finger like paralysis
I swear that incident happened
'cause I was out of it I swear
I swear you say that
once is is always
And now that time
where we existed lives far away
Been tryna work it out
but patience is worn
If you ever get some roses better
check 'em for thorns and say
They said we were a match
made in heaven
I guess you never saw it that way
Oh the flowers I gave you
and the love songs I made you
I will never give you roses again
Remember that time
where we were sittin’
by the lake hmm
And we were talkin’ 'bout
all the mistakes I make hmm
How all that shit them broads
were talkin’ 'bout was fake hmm
And every apology that
I gave you wouldn’t take hmm
Is it my fault that you
were used to datin’ rappers
And is my only gift
to you a little laughter
What about that glass
slipper happy ever after
when you walked all of me and
was surprised the glass shattered
Shoulda known that I was sharper
than that huh princess
And fuck ya teapots
yeah the twin sets
Fuck ya wind chime
when the fuckin' wind hits
And fuck that pillow
that you ordered that ain't in yet
Could give a damn about ya
new school buggie
Errybody know the old school’s
better hunny bunny
So let this be my last bouquet
I be hoppin’ in the game
I got a field to play and say
They said we were a match
made in heaven

A semicolon hovering where something once was menacing
A soon to be continued that exists after the ending screen
The only song I know that I would ever even wish to sing
When heat is blistering, you're the ice that's glistening inside my cup of tea, which is also you--Interesting
Throughout all the seasons in this transition of winter spring
You've been here beside me with the sweet nothings your whispering
You're a lovable angelic piece of perfect, and anything I do for you is worth it times a million and a half
We can sit and be resilient and laugh
In between the subtle compliments and billions of half-kiss half-hug half-cuddle moments we share
And I know it's unfair that we can only spend a few days here
But I'm yours and I think that it's clear, so forget about goodbye, this is see you soon, my dear
'Cuz I love you and I'd like to spend forever in the subtle warmth inside your arms like fireplace's embers
I will try my best to keep you by my side 'til the weather
Turns apocalyptic and we end up drifting to the nether
But we'd be still be wearing sweaters when we got there
Because we're both too caught up all in our cuteness to care about hot air
And even if it burnt me alive, I'd have my crosshairs set up on your heart, making art 'cause why stop there
I keep on creating for you until my final days
Dancing in the living room, and smooching while the vinyl plays
I've been losing track of the romantic shit I'm tryna say but basically, I love you
And that's kinda gay
Imma stay by your side when I can, and keep your grip on my hand
Because we can both hear the compliments coming in from these pals of mine
I've been wondering if you would be my valentine

Blowin' wedding rings

Verse 3
Man, I loved you when I'd seen you
Like I was only one up in the venue
Like you was puttin' on the fuckin' show of a lifetime
And everything was scripted
Like a scene off of Lifetime
Like what I need time for
When you make it stand still
And you change your whole sound
But girl I'm your fan still
Girl, you know looks kill
You goofy, I love it when you goofy
I love the fact that you can balance that with being boujee
Put me on to new things
And show me how to eat good
Used to be a good thing
Everything was all good

to hear the sound of you
Please calm me down

I don't wanna do this
I don't know how
to do this without you
Cling to your side
Voices at night
Cover my eyes
I'm terrified
No in between
A face on a screen
Ain't an adequate replacement
For your being with me
Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the land line
Want it so bad but i won't lie
And it just gets worse
in the night time
Never stays for long
And she's gone in the morning
When you come home
I just got over being less of you
When you leave me
I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose
Tell me how your day was
No i'm not okay
I don't know i don't know i don't know
I don't know i don't know i don't know
Time never moved so slow
Bed time hit your phone up
Tell me where to go where to go

woes of life
Just broken down as rain
kept steady pouring

and we philsophized
But the only truth that
we surmised
Is rain will fall so the
rose will keep on growing
Sometimes it's hard to
understand
How fate can deal with
such a heavy hand
But in the end
You're gonna find that
strength that lies within
And in the end
All you need is the
comfort of a friend
And in the end
You won't break cause you're
learning how to bend
And the hand of God will
guide you always
In the end
Now I know a woman so abused
By the hands and words
husband used
Till the day would come
when she could take no more
With two little girls
she was left to feed
She taught them strength
and self esteem
Now she's an inspiration
to everyone she meets
I know that life
has a funny way
of bringing out
the best by
bringing on the pain
But in the end
A little love's gonna
bring you back again
And in the end
Every answer's written on
the wind
And in the end
Looking back you can
finally understand
He was always there
beside you
You'll see
Cause I know the fight
when you struggle
every morning
Just to face that world
one more day
And you're holding on
to life
while a northern wind
is blowing
Just believe your help
is on the way
on the way
Oh in the end
You're gonna find that
strength that lies within
And in the end
You're gonna get there
no matter where you've been
Cause in the end well
The one truth is love
will always win
And the hand of
God will guide you
Just believe and let Him in
Cause in the end well
A little love's gonna
bring you back again

Thinking 'bout you lately
Maybe you can save me
From this crazy world we live in
And I know we could happen
Cause you know that I've been feeling you
Verse 2
Storms they will come
But I know
That the sun will shine again
He's my friend
And he says that we belong together
I'll sing a song
To break the ice
Just a smile from you would suffice
It's not me
Being nice girl this real tonight
Chorus
Cause I've been
Thinking 'bout you lately
Maybe you can save me
From this crazy world we live in
And I know we could happen
Cause you know that I've been feeling you
I know you want me
Bridge
There's no other
There's no other love
That I'd rather have
You know
There ain't no one
There ain't no one else
I want you for myself
Chorus 2x
Cause I've been
Thinking 'bout you lately
Maybe you can save me
From this crazy world we live in
And I know we could happen
Cause you know that I've been feeling you
I know you want me

But then I feel it
That you would be the only one
Sometimes
it doesn't have to be so sure
The sweetest love
can be so hard to find
We'll be better in every way

To fall in love again
to be the one for me
Sometimes you fall
but there'll be time
we'd be together
We'll be mad in every way
Then I remember
the store we went last september
Sometimes
recalling things would be so good
It's like perfect cake
that my grandma's made
Sometimes you feel off
but sometimes you feeling right

For so many days, I'm missing it all
Where did our time go
I'm scrollin' through pictures saved on my phone
I wanna go home

And I don't know why, but I'm so, sentimental

Lately I've been thinking of our memories
All the laughs we shared
And all the tears we cried

Hope you know that I'm forever grateful
All the time you shared
Staying by my side
Thank you for the love

I gotta say
There's still many days when I feel alone
So I pray to God
And then He reminds me, I'm not alone
He gave me you

Woah it's, just so easy to be sentimental

Lately I've been thinking of our memories
All the laughs we shared
And all the tears we cried

Hope you know that I'm forever grateful
All the time you shared
Staying by my side
Thank you for the love

And when I find myself in pieces on the ground
You pick me up and turn me back around
And any day could be our last
So I'll be holding onto all the love we found

Lately I've been thinking of our memories

And all the tears we cried

tell me not to get attached

And there ain't nothin’

I'll make it to where you are

I'll just hold you tight tonight
Though I don't see you day to day
Nothing will change
‘cause my love will remain
Well no need to rush
let's take our sweet
sweet time
‘Cause you know that in the end
we'll be so much more than friends
And you'll be mine all mine
And even though distance
might keep us apart
It wouldn't stop me
from giving you my heart

might be a big mistake
But you know you're worth the risk

I'm feelin' good hope the feelings are mutual
If not well I got the remedy the cure
Don't get it twisted my intentions are pure
I just want to address an ongoing issue
we all struggle with it maybe
with tears and tissues
misusing adjectives the name of the game
calling some people beautiful
and other people plain
can I just say that we are going insane
putting things on pedestals
which are truly inane
got the new kicks and clothes
but we still complain
are we really afraid of being some kind of lame
well I'm a messenger with something to say
you yes you are beautiful in every way
don't let the world tell you anything else
and put a big smile on
'cause it's good for your health and sing
*even when the sun goes down
I will shine and spread my love around
even when the moon goes out
I will shine and give my love my love to you
now I'm not trying to say
that your troubles go away
I'm just trying to tell you
that you're lookin' nice today
even with your sweatpants on
your big bright smile makes my worries go gone
I think we all forget how far our words go
mean things to say can make a nice day ice cold
we all know the small things in life
the smiles the compliments that help us get by
so please take this song as a gentle reminder
that life is much BRIGHTER
if you're generally kinder
so once you've done said
it you can't hit rewind
and just remember words
are the gates to the mind
and the soul love is what fills the holes
in the gaps of the hearts
that will break the old mold
if you're resonating with me
that love matters the most
from me to you then I do propose
this toast and so we sing

At first I thought that I was dreamin'
But then I heard the voice of a girl
And it sounded like she��d been cryin'
Now I'm too worried to be sleepin��

Pre-Chorus
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
She opened up and I asked about the things I've been hearing

Chorus
She said, I think your ears are playing tricks on you
Sweater zipped up to her chin
Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing
She said, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind
She said, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind

Verse 2
So I was layin' on the floor of my room
Cold concrete on my back
No, I just couldn't shake the feeling
I didn't want to intrude because I knew that I didn't have all the facts
But I couldn��t bear the thought of leavin�� her

Pre-Chorus
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
She opened up and I asked about the things I've been hearing

Chorus
She said, I think your ears are playing tricks on you
Sweater zipped up to her chin
Thanks for caring, sir, that��s nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing
She said, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind
She said, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind

Bridge
Aim my boombox at the roof, I'm playing Lean on Me
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I hope she knows she'll be okay
Aim my boombox at the roof, I��m playing Lean on Me
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I know exactly what I'll say
Promise I'm not playing tricks on you
You're always welcome to come in
You could stay here for an hour or two
If you ever need a friend

Chorus
We can talk about the noise, when you're ready, but 'til then
I'll say, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind
I'll say, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind

when the cops come through
and the whiskey's run out
'Cause I've been lookin' at you

wanna take this downtown
This liquid courage got me
way too honest
Put your phone on vibrate
let's catch a vibe babe
while the sun's down
Hush now
I know we're a little too fucked
up to stay still love
Be as quiet as you can
'cause if anyone sees
they'll just blow shit up
I don't gotta know
if you're taken
I'll just let ya know
bedroom's vacant
No one's gotta know
just us and the moon
'til the sun starts wakin'
Up's the only direction I see
As long as we keep this
Low low low low low
low low low-key
Ah-ah ah-ah
You ain't even gotta
lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- love me
Ah-ah ah-ah
Us in a king-size keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen
I don't wanna leave this
Low low low low low
low low low-key
Wizard with words tellin' me
my energy's so bewitchin'
So I'll go first there's an open bar
let's close this distance
Oh oh oh oh oh my
don't make me have
to spell it all night
I don't really give a fuck
'bout all the 'he said
she said' bullshit
So pick your poison love
let's go somewhere
a little more exclusive
Take a shot take a chance
take my hand boy
Tension so intense
like an asteroid
Be discreet gotta dodge
all the tabloids
Let's not think too much
there ain't no problems
So long as we keep this
Low low low low low
low low low-key
Ah-ah ah-ah
You ain't even gotta
lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- love me
Ah-ah ah-ah

Say I'm your queen

Or that my body becomes weak
Or that I can hardly move
at the very thought of you
Nothing ever really got to me
I could always turn
the other cheek
Could it be those days are gone
I could have sworn
that I was strong
Well at least stronger
than these emotions
that are taking over me
I swear I'm stronger
than these emotions
but they're taking over me
No no no this can't be it
Unless you are unless she is
Well no no no
cuz I can usually handle this
It's just I wasn't ready for these
I wasn't ready for these emotions
that are taking over me
I swear I'm stronger
than these emotions
but they're taking over me
You're the silence
in a roaring crowd
You're the equivalent
of a fluffy cloud
A genie in a bottle
make a wish to wish
the wishes would never end
And they never end
You're the platinum
in my treasure chest
You're the answer
that I never would have guessed
on my love life test
And I don't mind at all
I don't mind at all
I swear I'm stronger
than these emotions
that are taking over me
I swear I'm stronger

Oh yeah

watch it melt through my hands
Falling on my feet
Nearby ants on the ground
Building bridges and towns
So robust and neat
so hard to believe
Deep in my eyes
There's so much to wonder
Even the sun goes through trouble
Shining her light fighting rubble
Looking for diamonds like the stars
Up so high and down so far
Nobody knows what's going on
So much around yet so much is gone
Out with the old in with the new
Just sit back and enjoy the view
A look at the time
You hear the bell chime
Take off your shoes
Fill up your space
And live with a grace
To find all things true
Beautiful and new
Don't close your eyes
It's splendor in disguise
Even the sun goes through trouble
Shining her light fighting rubble
Looking for diamonds like the stars
Up so high and down so far
Nobody knows what's going on
So much around yet so much is gone

she fuck with a old soul

to the devil for this mojo

But she make my breath
stop like she the centerfold
Well I've been searching
for something sweet
That's cool in the summer
to take away this heat
Vanilla coke she much too bland
The lime try too hard chasing
all the other men
Well I'm just searching
for classic and timeless
Oh hey there I think I found it
She my cherry cola
She gon' keep me sober
Let me keep you closer
Bubbly like a soda
Sweeter than the champagne
Smoother than this Coltrane
Keep me from the chardonnay
I'm just sippin' one thing

If it's not you then if won't do
If it's not you then it won't do
Before you I was drowning
Way deep in this fountain
Pull me to the surface
No way I deserve this
Sweet like that sugar cane
I'm so glad that you came
No clouds in my sky
'Cause she bring that sunshine
Hold me down
Hold me down
Hold me down
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown

And folks dressed up

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's
child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
really know how to fly

한참 웃으며
맛있는 것도
자주 먹으러 다녔잖아
나 일부러 없는 멋도 부려
좋은 모습만 보여주려 했는데
친구로 지내자니
그래 뭐 내가 그렇잖니
영환아 대체 뭘 기대한거니
원래 항상 그래왔었지
그래도 넌 아니길 바랬는데
당연하단듯 이렇게 돼버리네
감미롭게
흘러가진 않는 인생 구도가
망가진채
다음엔 또 어떻게
굴러갈런지 대체
나는 그래도
널 미워하거나 뭐 그러지는
않을것 같어
지금 이대로라도 너를
볼수만 있다면
나는 괜찮어 근데 너는 별로
안괜찮아 보이는걸

As I pulled away you whispered stay
I was in a trance
I happen to know that

But that makes no difference to me
I know this love is doomed

I didn't think I'd find you here
Roaming in the corners of my mind
Well in there you'll find
A note that I wrote the other day
Don't read it just leave it
It might give me away

You're always so complacent
And though I laugh along
I find you test my patience
Sure I have less fun
when you are not around
And when I come to think of it
my feet don't touch the ground

You were everything I didn't need
Just a book I was told I should read
Never looked close enough to see
That you were standing there
with your heart
On your sleeve right from the start
Competing for my heart

I wouldn’t mind
to light a billion more
Or how I like to wake up

I’d still give you a ring
the way you are
Or stay up on the phone
late at night when you’re alone,
looking out the window gazing up
at stars

why I do the things that I do,
honestly I don’t know

All these questions and answers,
I just like to have her,
every moment every single day
Why I love to hold you
even in the public,
you could call it lovely PDA
I don’t care what city,
you could pick out of the 50 states
like California in the bay
Or how I like to take you
to church on every Sunday,
holding hands together as we pray
I don't care if people hate,
I don't care what people say,
cause my love for you
will always be the same

It's jealous
that you light up my life
And when the rain pours

It tries to ruin all our plans
But it can't
There's not much the world can do

nothing can us stop us now

And colored of the fall
They boast of their beauty
But darlin' you surpass them all
I've been blessed
with the privilege
Of loving you babe
You're proof that God makes
no mistakes Oh no no
And O what a beautiful girl
He made

And when life
When life's an unstoppable force
And it tries to take us off course
We'll be immovable
And when dreams
As beautiful as they may seem
Ain't better than reality
Cuz baby we're better

And how in bed we play
It's the way you kiss
my cheek when you think
That I'm asleep
I love it so much
I love you words
I never say friends make fun
but I tell you every day anyway
lately you been getting me
home safely
Wake up love the coffee that you make
Ask me how my night was I like us
its so easy and we don't ever fight
cause you don't blow up my phone
when your home alone
Assuming that
I'm doing what a guy does
Trust with just the right amount of lust
Even loved by my family
that a must and fun everything
we do me and you
My song comes on and
you dance n sing too with
the windows down like Gs
we don't care who's around
or who sees
And everyone is jealous
of my ride because you sitting
in the passenger side
It's the simple things you do
I just can't get enough of you

The way you do your hair
That I love so much
And it's the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It's the way you kiss
my cheek when you think
That I'm asleep
I love it so much
Everyday scrubbing it loving it
cruising freeways in our
PJs cause that's the fun of it unless
You wear that pretty
black dress O yes
Catch me in a suit so
I can look as good as you but I don't
O well with a that smile
that you wear so well
And the way that you cry
in movies pass you the ball and
you pass it back to me
Beer s with the guys aint
no thing it's your eyes
and the simple things
That make this work like
it should when you rock
my shirt o you look so good
So take my hand stay as long as
you can with the man
That tells all the jokes only you
understand and
I promise to be honest
if you promise to accomplish
love all we need is love
It's the simple things you do
I just can't get enough of you
It's that perfume that you wear and
The way you do your hair
