But you like me better backed up
in the corner
I don't wanna go there
But every time we fight it feels
like keeping my head over water
You're talking to me
like you got any power
I don't wanna go there
You make ultimatums
Don't you understand
All that's gonna happen
If you go to force my hand
I pick me
Every day every night
every single week
I pick me
When you're holding me down
I'll get up and leave
I pick me
Who I am and who I'm gonna be
I pick me
I don't need an owner
Can't you just support me
the way that you're supposed to
Every time you push me
I get even colder
You make ultimatums
Don't you understand
All that's gonna happen
If you go to force my hand
I pick me
Every day every night
every single week
I pick me
When you're holding me down
I'll get up and leave

I'll always pick me

When you said goodbye
that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over

got me on the defense

just a false pretense
Took my hat off
made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

밤새 울고 있었다
눈이 부어 있었다
너가 떠오르던 날
유난히 시끄럽던 창밖
나는 유난을 떨고 있다
취해 있다
미안 전화해서 헛소리한 거
지금 또 해명하는 것도
쿨하게 헤어져 놓고
추하게 헷갈리게 하는 것도
이 핑계 또 저 핑계를 대고
회색깔 녹은 눈처럼
잘 살고 있는 너에게 자꾸 질척대고

하얗게 칠해졌던 새벽
아무것도 보이지 않아
이곳을 헤매이고
가벼운 눈덩이들은
또 검은 내 머릴 때려
적중 어깨에는 짐이 가득해
웃는 너의 사진들은
자꾸 나를 자극해
나를 망쳐 놓으려면 다 부숴 놓고 가
왜 나를 남겨 내 세포까지
다 죽여 놓고 가
그땐 뭐가 그렇게도 즐거웠었나
추운 곳을 피해
얼굴이 또 붉어졌던 밤
난 같이 덮고 있던 이불을 다 태워
매일 아침 꺼진 불씨가
깊이 잠든 날 깨워
그건 차가웠었고 우린 뜨거웠었다
그냥 웃고 있던 너가
잠깐 부러웠었나 봐
내 울음 소린 캐롤송에 묻혀
밤새 내린 눈에 쌓여 만들어진 무덤
새하얀 세상이 겨울을 밝힌다
우린 눈치 없이
웃고 있는 그들과 섞인다
눈사람은 녹아버려서 눈물이 된다
밤새 눈이 오던 날
밤새 눈이 오던 날
수북이 쌓인 눈에 내 발을 담가 놔
질척거려 나는 그냥 그런 사람이었나
그냥 그런 지나가던
다 녹아버린 눈 다 녹아버린 눈

허드슨을 보며
혼자 기록했던 노래들은
만들었어 돈을
나도 알아 너의 노력 들은 모두 결국
너를 위해 돌아올거야
and i still love you
삶의 모든 순간이 무너질 때
웃는 날이 올 거야 슬퍼하지마
너는 그 자리에서 있어주라
조금 느리더라도 이뤄낼거야
때가 되면 떠나 약간의 유명세는
전부 떠날 때면 있어 내 옆에 넌
yo 난 내가 왔던 곳을 기억해
시간이 걸렸지만
everything is be ok
해 마다 계속 바뀌는 flow
또 비싸졌지 랩퍼들의 차키는 더
그 대신 나는 너를 더욱 아끼려고
내 삶이 무너지려 할때
내게 갈피를 줘
온 세상이 내가 무너지길 바랄 때
어두운 시간들은 영원할 것만 같았네
but i'm still standin here
with my pokerface
속으론 웃고 있지
it's kinda like joker face
언제까지나 우리에게
희망이 있길 빌어
실망하기엔 일러
인생의 여정은 아주 길어
너 자신을 믿어
내일은 좀 더 나을지도
또 한 발을 딛어 don't think
twice go & get em lets go
삶의 모든 순간이 무너질 때
웃는 날이 올 거야 슬퍼하지마
너는 그 자리에서 있어주라
조금 느리더라도 이뤄낼거야

추운 겨울날이 됐고
싸늘한 건 익숙해
바라지도 않아 따스한 한마디 위로는
내가 원하던 끝엔 네가 서있었지만
사실은 없던 거야
뭔갈 착각했던 것 최면에 걸린 듯
신기루같이 잡히지 않아
비워내 버렸지 같은 추억
여전히 신경 안 쓰겠지만
난 그저 네가 나를 의식해 주길 바래
다음날 차 버려 blanket
여전히 남은 숫자 1이
지워지지 않아
하나둘씩 지워가지
혼자 설렜던 story
그게 맘에 미련이 남아
나오는 눈물 참지
이제는 끝내야 해 바보였지 나 그때

How can we leave 'em be
Like stones thrown at the ocean
Forgotten at the bottom baby
How can we leave 'em be
Like stones thrown at the ocean
Forgotten at the bottom baby
How can we leave 'em be like stones
Can't say I never lied no
Can't say I never cried no
But I'm just really happy bein'
part of your life
Tell me you're just happy bein'
part of my life
Don't remember every night now
Don't remember every smile now
Memories are fadin'
but I know
we just leave 'em be like stones
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
How can we leave 'em be like stones

Conversations with a stranger
I barely know
Swearing this will be the last

My bad habits to lead to
wide eyes stare into space

when the good times start
Falling over everything to
reach the first times spark
Started under neon lights
then it all got dark

then you should've asked
Would you please stop acting

I'm checkin' my texts
and readin' 'em back
We were cool
at least I thought so
Seein' all this
and hearin' all that
We were good
but I guess we're not though
It was never real enough
for you to be mad
So why you out there acting
like the ex I never had
My friends would know about ya
if it was really love
I only saw you
when the sun wasn't up
Oh it's never gonna matter

Through the internet on a phone
Funny how I would stalk you
But when I dial you up, I turn to stone
My brain is spinning in circles
The sky's turning purple
Got no other plans
that I can understand
I can't learn to be lonely
And it's nights like these it really shows
Oh, I don't mind being alone
on a Friday
Why does nothing ever
seem to go my way?
I'm still pacing up and down
this damn hallway
It hurts to know that you're out there
I'm still here at home
If this night was a painting,
it'd be monochrome
I try to function
but I cannot function without you
I'm at a junction of letting you go,
don't know how to
Get panic attacks when I go to a place
that is crowded
'Cause I see your face on every person
that's out there
I force myself to feel something
but I just get nothing
Can't look for someone to fix
what is already broken
Now I'm at a junction of letting you go,

'Cause I never learned

Verse 1
I never ran as fast as all the other kids did
At times I get too frustrated then I loose it
I feel like every time I try I'm being outbid
I cannot curb it
I'm being outbid
I wish there was I certain thing at which I excel
Sometimes I can't control my brain feel like bombshell
I always have this way of sabotaging myself
But do I need help

Verse 2
I tend to disappear a couple days, don't call back
And I don't listen, so I end up faking interest
I focus way too hard on me and all that I lack
That I lack
It can't be like that
Always so scared to take a risk, was never like that
I had to play it safe experiences fall flat
I guess I'll handle it by taking it in small steps
Small steps

So give it to me straight
Just give it to me, babe
I'll handle it, you know I'm built that way

Found myself in your home, said hello, put my name in your phone
Lost my friends
Our first date walked to Pier 66
My lips, your lips, my heart beating right out my chest
When I held you I had something that I knew I need so bad
Yeah I need
Your love so bad
Oh, oh
Your love so bad
Oh, oh
Your love so bad
Oh, oh, oh

Economy, flew to deep Mexico
For a week you and me all alone
Till forever I had something that I knew I need so bad

Getting late, getting late, getting late
Should I take you home?

By the way, by the way that you’re holding me close

to exist to please the crowds
When will I be the next thing?

with the storm clouds
But inside, there's not a dry eye
in this whole house

tears keep falling down now

I just get caught up in myself

I underestimate

Just remember who showed you that
Used to be about yourself, now you're selfless
Glad I could do that, but

Pre-Chorus: Kiana Lede
I don't fuck with you like that anymore
But I still think about that time in New Orleans, oh na
It's kinda messed up she don't have to see
How you messed up when you were with me

Chorus: Kiana Lede
It's a shame she gon' know everything I taught ya
It's a shame she gon' get to see your better you
It's a shame that I went through all that shit
It's a shame she don't even see the come up
It's a shame, ah yeah

Verse 2: Kiana Lede
Yeah, I gave you time 'cause I was blind and I was patient
Tried to focus on the good times but the bad out-weighed it
I'm way too good, baby don't stress
Had to let you go so you can be a blessing
Or another girl's lesson

Verse 3: Blackway
Look, you foul but never been cold as this
I pull your cards so much, I got an abundance of poker chips
I can't front, I though about you
Then I wrote a song about you
Two verses, recorded a bridge
And then got over it
So I ain't tripping, just look how cool my composure is
Ain't finna text you with all that I need some closure shit
I can't tell if I'm still salty but don't post a pic with my ex pose
Or I'ma have to expose the bitch, nah
I've been out of it, gotta tear me some vitamins
For all that jazz, you be sounding like Mitchell Donovan
You be talking all kinda shit
Still can't see that the problem is
'For I got up inside, girl you didn't know what a condom is
If the fire burn out, don't trip, just let it
But I live that kinda life to make a bitch regret it
I ain't gonna complain or vent to sound all sympathetic
But whenever you ride his dick, make sure you give me credit

Outro: Kiana Lede
It's a shame she gon' know everything I taught ya
It's a shame she gon' get to see your better you

it'd be monochrome

but I cannot function without you
I'm at a junction of letting you go,
don't know how to
Get panic attacks when I go to a place
that is crowded
'Cause I see your face on every person
that's out there
I force myself to feel something
but I just get nothing
Can't look for someone to fix
what is already broken
Now I'm at a junction of letting you go,
don't know how to
I try to function
but I cannot function without you
Oh, I don't mind being alone
on a Friday
Why does nothing ever
seem to go my way?
I'm still pacing up
and down this damn hallway
It hurts to know that you're out there
I'm still here at home
If this night was a painting,
it'd be monochrome

Can you even imagine
All the people that haven't
Got no presents no mistletoe
Some are living without a home
Waking up in the morning
And there's nobody calling
All wrapped up in a winter coat
Still longing for someone to hold

And I don’t know what night it is

Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight

My friends say
It's just a new beginning
She wasn't right
Just give it time
There'll be a better one for you
Don't wanna try to numb the pain
Im not the one who wanted change
Got all these memories in my head
The ones I don't wanna forget
Don't wanna lose
I remember nights
and the parties with you
You'd look at me like
there's no one else in the room
How did we let it go
And how do we get back to that
We should be alone
making love on the roof
Just lying in my arms looking up
at the moon
How did we let it go
And how do we get back to that
Blue eyes
The only ones I wanna see
Your blue eyes
But they're not staring back at me
I couldn't tell
The way you felt
The things you didn't see in me
Don't wanna try to numb the pain

about to jump out of my chest

was so distracted

almost every night
I wonder what would happen
if called you to say Hi
Would you yell
go to hell and hang up the phone
Or suggest that
we met somewhere alone
Cause I've been trying
to figure it out
But I'm so lost without you
I really wanna know
Ooooh do you think about me
Ooooh do you really
think about me anymore
I wish I didn't miss you
but I'd lie to you
We're better together not alone
Ooooh do you really
think about me at all
Is it me that you see
when you touch yourself
Or does he make you feel
feel like you've never felt
Ooooh say do you think about me
Ooooh do you really
think about me anymore
I wish I didn't miss you
but I'd lie to you
We're better together not alone
Oooh do you really
think about me at all

Then I might bе on to somethin'

Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth

Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too

Cause I’m in sunshine
when you’re next to me
And all the birds sing in harmony
You put me at ease
Every time you’re touching me
It’s your love
That always get me back on top
It’s your love
That always makes me feel enough
I knew on the day I met you
That you would save me life
It’s your love
That always gets me back on top
Just like a rocket into outer space
I go from lower into uppercase
And if you’re standing
at the finish line
Then I will always come in first place
And I swear I’m walking on air
It’s your love
That always get me back on top
It’s your love
That always makes me feel enough
I knew on the day I met you
That you would save me life
It’s your love
Baby yeh it’s your love
It’s your love
That always gets me back on top

be in his cages all the time

난 부서지는 게 무섭지 않아
힘들 땐 잠시만 갓길에 세워
졸음쉼터는 찾으면 가까이 있어
Wake up 해
세상은 무에서 무
유에서 full 소유
그들은 여전히 굵은 선 긋기 중
우린 무에서 유
무에서 유
그어진 투명한 선을 넘어
Ready to move

한때는 얻지 못했어 원한 걸
계단 앞에서 무너지고 없었어 보람도
굳게 먹었던 마음을 일으켜 다시 한번
꾸겨진 지폐 몇 장이 다였어 쥔 거라곤
차가웠던 이 서울 속
파도 같던 그 설움도
밀려와 또 불만족
난 믿지 않았어 거울도
필요해 우린 큰 감동
다신 뒤로 가지 않고 고개를 위로
불신하지 않고 무릅썼던 위험
밤이고 낮이고 할 일 해 어떠한 것도 못 막지 옆으로 치워
당하고 살기는 싫어 지저분했던 그 시절 기억들은 지워
늦었지만 이젠 행복한 추억들만 머리 가득히 더해
더는 아껴 먹지 마 엄마 내가 보탤 게 통장에다 더해

내 팔 다리 생활의 달인
30까지 무식하게 버텨 악바리
하루 빨리 때려치란 아버지의 말이
나오지 않게 벌떡 걷어차 이부자리
날 끌어내리는 말들 선 넘어 반칙
끄떡없어 반지하 출신의 간지
잃을게 없는게 차라리 낫지
그 몇 푼 가진다고 죽 쓰진 않지
잘 깨고있어 내 한계
넘어서 보여줘야 돼 반대
가진 거 없이 여기 올라와 밤엔
술 아니면 담배로 위로하고 봤네
난 살았어 가난과 함께 근데
오늘 부로 선 그을 거 같애
이가 없다면 잇몸 써서라도
만들어 성공은 내게서 탄생
I wake up with no make up
지겨웠던 악몽을 매일 꿨던
과거를 뒤로 하고 위로 way up
새로 산 조던을 신고 lay up
어두웠던 만큼 밝은 내 아침
서러웠던 내 서울살이 마침
고생한 끝에 낙이 찾아 왔지
SINCE GO UP 이제 하늘에 닿지

끼니때를 놓치며 지켜냈던 내 추임새
정치와 정치질을 구분해 통수치는 이리 떼를 분리해
대중의 평가는 타이트해 왠지 토박이 감성은 불리해
다짐했어 그들의
다섯 손가락에 처음 접히는 이름이 나이게
매일 안방 바로 옆방으로 잠수타
폰 꺼놓고 밤새 write a rhyme
그때 떠난 친구들은 얼마나 날
쓰레기 새끼로 봤을까
빚더미 아래 정신승리 했던 내가 기억나
그래 넓은 집구석에서도 바퀴벌레는 튀어나와
수천 번 노크했던 문은
닫혀있긴 해도 잠겨있진 않았기에 then I kick in the door
청춘의 오만함으로 버텨
이젠 노래방 애창곡에 몇 자리 배치하고 두 손엔 오만 원짜리 벽돌

무거운 몸을 또 일으켜 세워
난 부서지는 게 무섭지 않아
힘들 땐 잠시만 갓길에 세워
졸음쉼터는 찾으면 가까이 있어
Wake up 해
세상은 무에서 무
유에서 full 소유
그들은 여전히 굵은 선 긋기 중
우린 무에서 유
무에서 유
그어진 투명한 선을 넘어
Ready to move

Let’s go back when I was 20
상하차 박스를 stackin’ uh
돈 때문이 아닌 starvin’
못 갚아 나간 월세집
하루에 절반을 넘게 써
모니터 앞에 갇혀진 내 lyrics
아침에 눈을 떠 봐도 안보여 내일이
성공은 잘사는 친구의 큰 티비
그 속에만 비치 안보여 길이
넌 항상 말했지 내 limit
무너져 2주를 물로 버틴 뒤
깨어나 보니 올라타 new wave 위
파도 타 코쿤형 새 곡에
깨있지 새벽에 keep ballin’ wit ma 808
돈 잘 버는 어린 veteran 지갑이였던 Saint Laurent
곧 초청돼 runway 그리곤 말하겠지 I’m not 연예인
큰집 sports car trophy in ma ‘rrari
아직 못간 곳 까지 날 알려 Olá ! To brazil

우린 좇아 감히
우린 좇아 감히
헌드레드 달러 빌
쫓아 Vêtement de Paris
Wake Up
꿈은 충분해 Wake Up
이젠 테이크오프
달려가 애비로드
목푠 밀리언달러 빌로 올라가
고갤 들어 Oui, oh garçon, C’est un choix de vie
Ah 비바 라 비다 우린 비바 라 비다
우린 Ah 비바 라 비다 우린 비바 라 비다

말만 해서 바뀌는 건 없지 내 가친 스스로 올려
곡예사도 좋지만 난 한마디로 '노력'
인생의 모든 맛봤고 이제 성공
작년에 봤던 맛은 에피타이저 정도
기억나네 내 첫 정산은 4000원
기댄 없었고 더 없었어 반전은
다음 해 대가를 억대를 가져도
아들 소식을 남한테 듣고서 받았던
살이 빠졌다고 말한 엄마의 전화
그렇게 됐는지 난 나조차도 몰랐어
그 방 안에서 흘렸던 눈물과 피와 땀
부끄럽고 부질없어진 것 같아 전부 다
그래 지금 난 망가졌기에
좀 더 어른으로 바뀌어야 해
멋진 사람이 되고선
없다가 있어도 있다가 없어도 안 변할게
내가 무에서 유가 되는 건
돈이 아닌 소중한 걸 챙기는 것
내가 들어왔던 이 경쟁의 판이
내 서사의 한편을 새기는 것
오늘 밥은 든든히 먹었어 아빠
이거 듣는 날 아들은 광주야
오늘 마지막으로 울고 웃을게
from. 잘 이겨내고 있는 아들이

무거운 몸을 또 일으켜 세워
난 부서지는 게 무섭지 않아
힘들 땐 잠시만 갓길에 세워
졸음쉼터는 찾으면 가까이 있어
Wake up 해

숨만 쉬어도 돈이 들어가니
그 돈을 위해 난 지금도 못 쉬어
커피가 내 포션 음음
내 무한도전
종방연은 멀었지
15년째 꾸준하게 넘고 있는 이 허들은 여전히 견고하지만
까진 무릎에도 내 비전은 새롭게 내 빽은 1만 시간
동기들은 내게 말해 쟤는 출퇴근 안 해 나보다 자유롭지
넌 몰라 그 자유로움의 무게가 얼마인지
내 가벼운 톤에 걸맞지 않는 내 책임감 장남의 고뇌
내 팀 내 동생 내 친구 내 식구를 담아놨기에 내 목은
이제 안 쉬어 쉬어 크게 숨을 쉬어 이미 난 Man of the year
음 Cheers Cheers 저 하늘 위로 렉시 누나처럼 다 일어서 yeah

오늘은 눈 좀 붙이고 쉬어
굳어진 몸을 풀어
차가운 목걸이가 조여
숨이 잘 안 쉬어지잖아
꿈꾸러 가자 좀 쉬어 쉬어

Pop like Beatles 시대의 시를 노래하지
내 전생은 이름 모르는 꽃일 거야
향기를 뿌리지
리스너들의 암술을 찾아내고 넌 꽂힐 거야
쉬어가지 말란 뭣 같은 말에 혹 하지 마
다 똑같이 말해 또 거짓말 뻔하지
콩깍질 껴야만 논하지 평판
난 결관 몰라 평가해 과정만
쉬어 같이 all night long
빨랑 빨랑 모여봐 여기 폴라로이드
찰칵 찰칵 거리지 모두 명장면
살짝 살짝 설렜어 like an OH MY GIRL
쉬어, 직역하면 심호흡
거북이는 비웃어 쉼표의 미덕
개미들의 피로와 베짱이의 빈곤을
비교하자면 난 기타를 집어
우린 환상이라면 MBTI가 닿지 않는 곳 그 이상을 봐
나는 기다리지
당신의 애인과 다신 안 올 긴 Field trip
천천히 해 모두가 급해
우린 꿈들 그 언저리에서
도전해보며 생을 보내자고
왜 모델이 런웨이를 겁내는 건데
건배

오늘은 눈 좀 붙이고 쉬어
굳어진 몸을 풀어
차가운 목걸이가 조여
숨이 잘 안 쉬어지잖아
꿈꾸러 가자 좀 쉬어 쉬어

쉼표, 찍게 해 줘
이름표와 나의 ego
그 사이에 많은 허들
넘어 다니기엔 지쳐
오늘은 눈 붙여
조금만 쉬어
숨을 들이 마셔
조금만 쉬어

지금 여기 내 운명으로
향하는 기차 안에서의 창 밖은
머릿속에 그린 상상들이
장관을 이루고
파란 하늘이 말하는 내 기분
막 잠든 평생 고생만 했던 내 엄마
이젠 뻗어 봐 편히 발
영화처럼 인생은 아름다워
야 나는 될 거라 기억하냐
친구 술에 취해 너와 비틀대 던 밤
희미해져 갈 때쯤 도착하겠지 그곳에
가끔 슬픈 노래를 듣곤 해
감정은 오랫동안
너를 제자리를 돌게 하니
큰 돈 세는 손에 묻히지 마 흙 모래
변해 버린 나를 욕해
아니면 차라리 날 잊어
기다리며 내겐 낮이며 밤이며
꿈꿔 온 순간이여
불행에 자란 집념과
내 야망의 안식처
Straight out the fuckin
dungeons of rap
다시 돌아온 Illionaire day
세월이 지나도 변하지 않는
Illionaire way
Ambition까지
완벽한 그림을 그리는 중
니들은 그리다 못해
물이나 흐리는 중
흐르는 듯 흐르는 flow는
어디로 튈지를 모르지
새로운 곡들이 나오기도 전에
새로운 비트를 고르지
오로지 노력 하나뿐
올라 온지 벌써 오래
but 더 높이 가는 중
시간이 가는 줄도 몰라
벌써 서른이 낼 모레
내가 여기까지 올 때
너넨 거서 아직 뭐 해
Sippin on some
moet cubans on 내 목엔
손목엔 rolex
이젠 지겨워진 이 노래
못해 아무도 이렇게
아직 까진 본적 없지
16년째 단 한 번도 편히 논 적 없지
I'm outchea 잠은커녕
조금도 존 적 없지
절대 마이크 땅에
놓은 적 없지 no doubt

the same tune

meant to be for me and you

to light up the room

When you'd get excited
When we danced
to old Christmas tunes
And Santa was asking about you
When he made his way down
from the roof
And he filled up your stocking
Before I could stop him
And tell him you found
somewhere new

From Harlem to the Battery

Suddenly it's Christmas in New York
Croquettes are warming up their kicks
Bum-bum-ba-la-la-la
Radio City sold out all of their tickets
The windows on Fifth Avenue
are dressed up
and they're telling you Ooh
Suddenly it's Christmas in New York
Find me on Broadway
or at the ballet Ooh
And I'm five years old again Ooh
Making my wish list
but all I wish is Ooh-ooh
For another Christmas in New York
Oh Santaland is ready to debut Ooh
When Macy is so packed
you can't get through Ah
The kids are lined up everywhere
spilling out into the square Ah
Suddenly it's Christmas in New York
Taxi
Take me straight to Central Park
You've got it lady
Welcome to the Empire State building
Rockefeller Center
Oh my god
Isn't the city beautiful
This way ma'am
Find me on Broadway or at the ballet
And I'm five years old again
Making my wish list but all I wish is
For another Christmas in New York
Can you hear the church bells
ring-a-ling
Ring ring dong ring
As the choirs do their caroling
Here we go caroling
The Saint Patties activity is
something everyone should see
Ah ah
It even makes the Grinch believe
Central Park looks beautiful in white
Central Park looks beautiful in white
Cuddled up and meet the blanket
taking in the sides Ah
The city is all red and green
wrapped up like a gift for me Ah
Finally it's Christmas in New York
No there's nothing better
We should all have
Christmas in New York

벌써 만난지도 일년이 됐어
우리 그때보다 변한 것이 있다면
좀 더 커져버린 사랑일거야

빨간 스웨터도 입혀줄거야
항상 포근했던 네 마음과 어울려
날 생각하면 정말 좋겠어
거리에 함께 나온 연인들
밤새 들려오는 노랫소리들
모두가 우리들의 만남을
축복하는 예쁜 선물들 같아
저기 하얀 눈이 내려
저 하늘 모두 내려
우리 서로 닿은 마음 위로
사랑이 내려
살짝 네 가슴에 기대 안겨
먼저 말을 할까
나를 느끼는 너의 모든 걸 사랑해
우리 처음 만난 일년 전의 오늘도
지금처럼 하얀 눈이 내렸지
추워 코 끝까지 빨개진 날 보면서
넌 놀려대며 웃고 있었어
가만히 빛을 내는 촛불에
지금 내 마음을 비춰 보일까
이렇게 너와 함께 있는 나
세상 누구보다 행복하다고
저기 하얀 눈이 내려
저 하늘 모두 내려
우리 서로 닿은 마음 위로
사랑이 내려
살짝 네 가슴에 기대 안겨
먼저 말을 할까
나를 느끼는 너의 모든 걸 사랑해
난 요즘 발라드 잘 부르는
여자한테 끌리네
나랑 스키장을 가자
보드 타자 눈 위에
만약에 탈 줄을 모른다면
내가 가르쳐줄게
넌 날 반하게 한 학생
난 네 강사 역할이네
Sweet한걸 원한다면
좋아 불러줄게 girl
나쁜 남자가 좋아
몸매 불러줄게 girl
다른 건 몰라도
we can make good music girl
다비치 what's good
AOMG로 놀러 와 girl
지금 네 바람이 들려
저 하늘까지 들려
나도 오늘밤엔
같은 소원 빌게 될 거야
많은 시간들이 흘러가도
우리들의 사랑
지금처럼만 간직해주길 기도해

이젠 너와 내가 친구 사이로 남아

마치 실이 빠진 진주
혹은 가벼운 티슈
우리둘 간에 issue makin은 이젠 없을거야
넌 아무 느낌두 안나겠지만서도
나 없는 밤이 긴듯 혼란스럽겠지
나 역시 옆구리 시린 just sandle
지루한 스캔들
내 안티팬들이 되버린
니 주위사람과 불리한 Game을
하기도 전에 Over를 쳤지만
Just painful Ye I just can do it
But can't be single
사랑 노랠 들어도
Where the melodies at
행동 하나 하나 모두 다 외로움이 돼
So Im officially missing you
날 떠난 너지만 아직 날 괴롭히네
나에겐 너 하나뿐인 걸
너 때매 아파 하는걸

얼굴에 닿은 햇살에 잠이 깨어

Map out my day

오늘 하루를 그려봐요

Try my best to stay awake

계속 깨어 있고 싶은데

Need me some coffee

커피나 좀 마셔야겠어요

Open up my windows and breathe

창문을 열고 숨을 들이쉬어요

Everybody’s doin the same thing

모두가 이렇게 지내고 있어요

It’s always been like that, yeah i know it

일상이란 언제나 그렇죠



Then the days flew by without me countin ‘em

그런데 생각지도 못한 날들이 다가오더니

Suddenly i’ve made my way around the sun

별안간 태양 주위로 환하게 열린 거예요



SPRING IS ON MY MIND

마음에 봄이 찾아왔고

THIS COLD DON’T FEEL RIGHT

이런 찬바람은 내키지 않아요

NEED YOU BY MY SIDE, BABY (BABY)

내 곁에는 그대가 필요해

TODAY TURNS INTO NIGHT

밤이 찾아오고 있어요

DON’T WANNA WASTE OUR TIME

시간 낭비하지 말자구요

PLEASE KEEP ME WARM, ALRIGHT BABY?

(BABY)

나를 따뜻하게 해줘요, 그럴거죠?

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH



One day i met somebody special

어느 날 특별한 사람을 만났어요

Not to get all sentimental

그렇게 감상적인 타입은 아니었지만

But he has a way of makin’ me forget

그 사람이 계속 생각나요

Outside of us

혼자 있을 때도



Don’t know where this is gonna end up

이런 감정이 어디서 끝날지는 모르겠어요

He might not even be the right one

그가 내가 찾던 사람이 아닐 수도 있지만

But i like him

그 사람이 좋으니까

Think i wanna get to know him

더 알아가고 싶어요



When we’re together days go by, stopped countin ‘em

우리가 함께 할 때 셀 수도 없는 날들이 흘러가요

Hand in hand we’ll make our way around the sun

함께 손을 잡고 우리는 밝은 시간 속에 피어날 거예요

Seasons go changin

계절이 바뀌어가듯

i guess so am i

나도 그런 것 같아요

Lately i’m thinkin if time’s on my side

요즘은 시간이 내 편인지 생각해봐요

People around me are hardly the same

주변 사람들은 달라져 가는데

Hope i’m not too far behind

내가 너무 머물러 있지 않기를

널 계속 쳐다보고 있을 때면
네 모습은 내 눈에 Slo-mo
빠르게 가는 시간 속
사진 찍어 머릿속에 Right
어쩜 아름다운 건
너와 좀 가까운 걸지 몰라
아마 이런 말들도
너에겐 아까운 걸지 몰라
너에게 말을 늘어놓을 땐
솔직해 거짓말 난 안 해
뻔한 말들을 난 꺼내
I just want your love
Fall in love
Our love is slow motion
친구 사이를 지나쳐
Slo-mo
Fall in love
Our love is slow motion
천천히도 괜찮아
Slo-mo
이 시간이 지나면
가까워져 우린 조금 더
네 행동 하나까지도
난 모든 걸 알게 될지도
어떤 말을 해야 네가
느낄 수 있을지 몰라
조금 천천히 너에게
마음을 다 비출 수 있게
Fall in love
Our love is slow motion
친구 사이를 지나쳐
Slo-mo
Fall in love
Our love is slow motion
천천히도 괜찮아
Slo-mo
널 처음 봤을 때부터
난 느꼈어 I feel I love you
네 행동 하나까지도
난 모두 놓치기 싫어서
널 계속 쳐다보고 있을 때면
천천히 내 마음에 닿아서
내 감정들은 더 커져
이 시간은 멈출지 몰라

I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
Smoking cheap pre-rolls
and listening to LANY
Hoping you don't hate me
I know it's lame
but this is how I'm coping without
Inside jokes and places
that you'd take me
Bet you probably blame me
I know it's lame
but this is how I'm coping
without you
Without you
Without you
Without you Without you
I'm the best at getting
disappointed
by my expectations
Try to read my mind
it's always racing
Damn I really love
to test your patience
Smoking cheap pre-rolls
and listening to LANY
Hoping you don't hate me
I know it's lame
but this is how I'm coping without
Inside jokes and places
that you'd take me
Bet you probably blame me
I know it's lame
but this is how I'm coping
without you
Without you

Wrapping up our presents singing Silent Night
Someone put a record on, the whiskey found some ice
Hips got shaking, shaking stevens and I woke up bloody eyes

[Chorus]
We had a little bit too much fun this Christmas Eve
Got a little too merry dancing around the tree
So I’m a little bit hoping Santa hasn’t been here and I can go back to sleep
‘Cause we had a little bit too much fun this Christmas Eve

[Verse 2]
I might stay in bed while you go walking in the snow
Wake me up again before the turkey gets cold
And when we take the family photo don’t be mad if I look stoned
I can’t hide if both my eyes are as red as Rudolph’s nose

[Chorus]
Yeah we had a little too much fun this Christmas Eve (yeah we did)
Got a little too merry dancing around the tree
So I’m a little bit hoping Santa hasn’t been here and I can go back to sleep
’Cause we had a little bit too much fun this Christmas Eve

[Chorus]
‘Cause we had a little bit too much fun this Christmas Eve
Got a little too merry, a little too merry dancing around the tree
So I’m a little bit hoping Santa hasn’t been here and I can go back to sleep
‘Cause we had a little bit too much fun
A little bit too much fun
A little bit too much fun this Christmas Eve
(Merry Christmas)

So I could just show up and bring the news
That she’s getting older
I wish that you’d met her
Coz the things that shel learn from me, I got them all from you

Can I stay a while and we’l put all the world to rights
The little ones will grow, and il still drink your favourite wine
Soon they’re gonna close but il see you another day
So much has changed since you been away

I wish that heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation
Haven’t a clue how I’d even raise them
What would you do? Coz you always do what’s right

Can we talk a while until my worries disappear
I’d tell you that I’m scared of turning out a Failure
You’d say remember that the answer in the love that we create
So much has changed since you been away

I wish that heaven had visiting hours
I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know they’d say, that it’s for the best
So i will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

I will close the door but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
This is not goodbye, it just until we meet again
So much has changed since you been away

I can't let go

in all these new faces

when everything changes
Tell me why
Why do I feel like I'm living

Still don't really know

Staring at the sky
always asking why
Screaming Who am I

잔을 채워 다시 내 앞에
모두 시끄럽게
터져 Poppin Champagne
Birthday 뒤풀이 아냐
Party on the Thursday
아마 Recipe
없이 나는 Like a Biebs
너네에게 난 씹을 거릴 Resting
I'm lit like bic 틱탁
시간 뒤에 Drip drip drip
Not a drinker
but she pouring up that champagne
Celebrations be in order
cuz we getting paid
Money coming steady
exes now actin strange
Only calling me at late
nights like I’m out of state
Like there’s time difference
Like I’m wide awake
I been losing sleep
Chasing bags
too much on my plate
Now the whole family feasting
You on that drive thru meal
in that new whip you leasing
The one that you was flexing
on the gram
Heard you bagged
a gold digger man
least you got a fan now
Your girl love that drip all on me
My day 1 homies never
switch up on me
Yeah we rolling with
the good vibes good vibes
Celebrating sip that
champagne all night
Celebrities around me
looking our way
If you ain’t in my section
than you salty
They seeing how we move
and they follow suit
Look at my resume got
nothing to prove
If you ain’t here to party
than I chuck a deuce
Take another sip see
her getting loose
They be hating on us while
we celebrating
Cause we winning winning
winning winning winning
Everyday we on a champagne diet
Everyday we on a champagne diet
Everyday we on a champagne diet
Cause we winning winning

Everyday we on a champagne diet

Shake that ass mama
Pull up on ya let me hit it

in a different place

running in a different race

Quit taking me back
We’re cruising down memory lane
But it’s fading to black
I desperately just wanna show you
All my new dreams the new me
But sometimes
I feel like you just never
really knew me

I guess I’ve changed huh

things anymore

Then took a day job
Cause I don’t clap

Cause I don’t brag

You knew that
I’d rather swing and miss
Than to do jack
These are the true facts
I get these dancers
swinging like it’s new jack
I gave you many chances
but you blew that
What more can I do
If you don’t listen to reason
And you don’t listen to logic
And just believe
we’re out to get you
Sounds like you’re the real problem
Sad to say it
But I gotta move on
So much growth ahead of me
There’s no room for
weeds in this garden
Can’t believe it took me
this long to set the boundaries
Just to love myself
We air out the dirty laundry
Got the doubters second guessing
At the edge of their seats
Your approval doesn’t have the same
control over me

Cause I don’t brag
at the same things anymore

The truth is what you get away with
Tell yourself it’s just a matter
of how you frame it
The truth is what you get away with
Dress it up enough
now you got a painting
The truth is what you get away with
Deceive enough people
now your words are blameless
The truth is what you get away with
Sell it to the masses
now your boy is famous
You say I’ve changed up
I guess I’ve changed huh
Cause I don’t laugh

who found comfort in each other

with this new girl
She's got a nice place
west of the 405
But I miss gettin' drunk
with you from a paper bag
Sometimes we drive up
the coast on the weekends
And party with her cool friends
at the Chateau Marmont
But I miss going nowhere
with you up and down Fairfax
What hurts the most is just
how close we got to
To the life we dreamed
now I'm doin' everything
without you
If it was up to me
I'd be with you every night
If it was up to me
I'd let you win every fight
If it was up to me
you would still still be mine
But it wasn't up to me up to me
I got my first check you always
said I'd make it
Have you heard they're playin'
LANY on the radio
Wish you were with me
celebratin' out in Malibu
I'm not sayin'
that my girl's not amazin'
I keep lookin' for a problem
but there's nothin' wrong
The only problem is
I can't turn her into you
If it was up to me
I'd be with you every night
If it was up to me
I'd let you win every fight
If it was up to me
you would still still be mine
But it wasn't up to me up to me
If it was up to me
ink your name on my arm
If it was up to me
closin' down that corner bar
If it was up to me

And we'll build this love from the ground up

We'll give all that we have

How the hell did we end up here?
Got to face another day

Could have done things differently
Could have said things quietly

Holding your grace

시간이 얼마나 걸리던 간에 be wildin’

몰라도 두팔 걷었지
애초에 목표는 하나였으니
한 번씩 흔들려도
잊었다면 나는 없지

거리감
요즘 따라 멀게만
높은 담장
그저 쳐다보기만
했던 날 죽였지
내가 바란 낭만 역시
그대로를 바라보기엔
너무 많이 컸지

밑줄 친 말들이 너무 버겁지
비싼 테두리는 더욱 날 못 가졌지
벙찐 숨소리에 답은 없듯이
모른 척 난 길을 걸었지

번쩍 들어 올리기엔 아직 버거워
바닥에 끌고 다니기엔 꼴만 한심해져
잠시라도 멈추면 난 또 멀어질걸
두려움에 나아가지 못한 날 자책해도

달라진 건 마음가짐뿐인걸
떨어진 건 발 아닌 품은 것들
싫어도 지겨워도 어쩌겠어
내가 택했던걸

되물어봐
질끈 감은 눈이 향한 대로 나아갔던
그때로 돌아간다면 나 변할까
믿어온 것처럼 운명이었을까 no

구차해 보이기 싫어서
억지로 나를 밀었어
날 다시 잡아줘

이제 와 던져 버린다면 변할까
이제 와 던져 버린다면 넌 알까

Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong
'cause I let you Let you
Usually I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different
got me lookin' stupid Damn
The only way I'm comin' back to you
is if you're dreaming lucid Hmm
Prove it if you made a promise
then keep it Keep it
Why you wanna lie and then get mad
I don't believe it Boy bye
But really I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine sippin' wine
dancin' on club couches Ah
Baby why you wanna lose me
like you don't need me
Don't need me
Like I don't block you
and you still try to reach me
How you figure out
how to call me from the TV Huh
You're runnin' outta chances
and this time I mean it Ah
Yeah bet you miss my love
all in your bed Bed
Now you're stressin' out
pulling your hair Hair
Smelling your pillows and wishin'
I was there I was there
Slidin' down the shower wall
lookin' sad Sad
I know it's hard to let go
I'm the best I'm the best
Best you ever had and best you gon' get
Gon' get
And if we break up
I don't wanna be friends Be friends
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
makin' beautiful mistakes

Don't know how to define
it or give it a name

Fucking me up
Floating through the night
then drowning all day
Hiding in my bedroom tryna escape
Cause it's fucking me up

Faking smiles
Pretending I'm not anxious
Hide from friends
But opening up to strangers
I don't wanna be dramatic
Cause it's all in my mind

and they keep calling
My phone light up and I ignore it
Got shit to do
No that ain't true

너의 빈 자리에
적어둔 노래
기억의 구름 뒤
쏟아져 내리는
너의 미소
너의 말들과
너의 뒷모습
우린 어느새 잊혀져간
그 어느 날 이야기들
기억할 수 있을까
외로움에 아파했던
우리의 마음들은 또
돌아갈 수 있을까
밤이 날 안을 때
무너지는 나의 마음
밤이 날 안을 때
너를 그리워하는
이런 나의 어둠에
너의 하늘을 가득 담아줘
Will you stay
Tell me goodnight
Tell me you love me
Goodnight goodnight goodnight
I’ll give you my whole life
Tell me goodnight

우리가 마지막에는 행복할 수 있을까,
We’ll be happy after all
확신하기 전까지는 마음을 바꿀 수 없는 걸

When I first met you
널 처음 만났을 때
It’s like my soul found
내 영혼이 마치
It’s own counterpart
짝을 만난 것 같았어
But time was never on our side
하지만 시간은 우리 편이 아니었지
Cause we’re too different
우린 너무 다르니까
In fading moments
희미해지는 순간들 속에서

Can't promise happy endings
해피 엔딩을 약속할 수는 없어
If I ever break your heart
만약 내가 널 아프게 한다면
I could never forgive myself
절대 날 용서하지 않을 거야

This time can I just let you go?
이번에는 내가 널 그냥 보내줘도 될까?
Lately I can’t change my mind until I know
우리가 마지막에는 행복할 수 있을까,
We’ll be happy after all
확신하기 전까지는 마음을 바꿀 수 없는 걸

Thinking back on all the times
지나간 시간을 돌이켜보자
That we had to say goodbye
우리가 작별 해야했던 때로 말야
I don’t wanna end it all this way
이렇게 끝내고 싶지는 않아
Is there something we could find
우리 사이를 다시 되돌리기 위해
To bring us right back to life?
할 수 있는 게 있을까?
So we can be okay?
그래서 우리는 괜찮을까?
Okay?
그럴 수 있을까?

This time can I just let you go?

기울어지는 관계 알면서도 못 잡았을까

I could stay in the dark
Hiding my broken heart
But then a light came on
Staying comfortable
Was a lie I've been sold
and what I thought was love
I was just cold

Not gonna change my mind
Get outta my way

No more baby
No way

Let me be
All the things I should’ve done
could’ve done
You won’t get the best of me this time

Sick and tired of watching
everyone’s feed
Experiencing life vicariously

what you’ve hidden away

What you want tomorrow
Might not wait for you

or we could go down in flames
And when you need some closure
I can be the one you blame
But we're young right now girl
you don't have to be afraid
Oh yeah
I won't hold you back no
cause there ain't no more to say
And you can keep the picture
baby I'll just keep the frame
And we build sand castles
just to let them blow away

man I thought I was a genius
From the verses to the chorus
to the part with all the ad-libs
It really had a lot of meaning
I really wish
that you could hear it
Now there's no point
in finishing I lost the spirit
Keep it in my drafts
then one day it'll disappear and

Why do I still love you
when I hate this
Got me keeping quiet

I don’t wanna have to hide it
I need somebody to confide in

You never call my telephone

What is it you’re holding on to
Because there is something wrong
I understand that
you may never want me close

Why do I even bother
When you never wanna stick with me
Instead of choosing others to favour
You know I can’t hate her
For watching him go chase her
When nothing
he could do could ever phase her
Got me sick and tired
Of the sneaking and the lying
But god knows that i’m trying to stay
But she’s denying that
she ever fell in love
With the pages of his mind
But she didn’t wanna
be in his cages all the time
Forgive me if you find me
replaying it in my head
You saying what you said
Words I wish I never read
‘Cause I

Through the internet on a phone
Funny how I would stalk you
But when I dial you up, I turn to stone
My brain is spinning in circles
The sky's turning purple
Got no other plans
that I can understand
I can't learn to be lonely
And it's nights like these it really shows
Oh, I don't mind being alone
on a Friday
Why does nothing ever
seem to go my way?
I'm still pacing up and down
this damn hallway
It hurts to know that you're out there
I'm still here at home
If this night was a painting,
it'd be monochrome
I try to function
but I cannot function without you
I'm at a junction of letting you go,
don't know how to
Get panic attacks when I go to a place
that is crowded
'Cause I see your face on every person
that's out there
I force myself to feel something
but I just get nothing
Can't look for someone to fix
what is already broken

주가는 상승세, I do my money dance, 더 깔끔해진 stance

일을 한번 시작했다 하면 잘 멈출 줄을 몰라
올해 휴가를 반납한 대신 ball out till I fall out
틀면 나온대 정기석 여기저기서 캐스팅하기 바뻐

어쩌면 radio에서나 묻겠지 안부도

계속 계속 계속 시간을 두 배로 뺏어
난 3개 먹어 최소 근데 왜 날 쉬게 안 냅둬
신호 바꿔 길 터 빽 판에 I gotta go
이대로만 lift it up 위로 가면 나로호

전역 박고 한 달 하루처럼 살아 덕분에 여름
바다 한번 못 봤어도 욕조에서 swim good

Aye please somebody call a fireman~

We coming with the heat
불 이모지
한 가득히 담아두지 하루종일
Baby I look so good
몇 만원짜리
티셔츠만 입어도
Now let me preach
불 이모지
두 손 모아 기도 thank you Lord
Ye we coming with the heat
Ye we coming with the
Ye we coming with the
Ye we coming with the heat heat heat heat

H E A T (아!뜨!)
S U N on me (후@끈@)
Stay 지붕 위에 앉아 내려봐
내 머리가 타는 기분 like fire
올라타 like spider
Hop on the coupe , Designer shoes
물 위를 걸을 땐 빛나는 Moon
뜨거운 Juice 한 모금 쭉 쭉
들이 키고 다시 떠버린 두 눈
차갑게 흔들리고 있는 두 줄
Drip흘러 수영할래 Full
Hood baby 이젠 가만히만 있어도
더워 죽겠네 Becuz
I'm too hot 끓는 점을 넘지
새빨개진 내 눈동자에 맺힌 lasers comin'
Ye I'm lookin like an Ironman
싸여 화염에
Aye please somebody call a fireman


거울속에 나는 왜 아직 너를 잊지 못하고
계속 위기로 위기로
어딨어 윙가르디움을 노래하던
잃을거 하나도 없는 녀석
정신을 차리고 온도를 올려
기다리면서 조금 더 달구어
시적 허용을 헤집고 다녀
메소포타미아같이
History is flowing with the ws와
위인은 101명이되 마치 달마시안
새우 가득한 팟타이 마냥 나이키 로고를 범벅하든
모든 브랜드를 섞어버릴 만큼 벌어버려 난

We coming with the heat
불 이모지
한 가득히 담아두지 하루종일
Baby I look so good
몇 만원짜리
티셔츠만 입어도
Now let me preach
불 이모지
두 손 모아 기도 thank you Lord

교회도 나갔지만 아버진 전직 목자

누구는 싫어해도
항상 되찾지 내 자리

나는 진심으로 내가
제일 잘 되기를 빌어

떠나지 나를 결국엔 다들
돈 문젠 1도 없는데
내 문제만 99개야
갖고픈 걸 아무리 다 가져도
마음은 우울하지
아주 비싼 시세일 때
난 가끔 미움을 사지
내 selfie는 곧 나의 mugshot
영화 속에 명대사도
대부분 악당들의 몫이야
악역도 나름 사연이 다 있다고
나의 가족과
사랑을 지키기 위해서라고 해도
과연 좋게 봐줄까
난 나밖에 모르겠어
영원히 이럴 놈이야
과거가 밥 안 맥여주니까
let's leave it all behind
이렇게 한 트랙 위에
서 있다해도 스윙스와

근데 the reason why
I do this shit
걍 돈 되니까 하는 거지 뭐
옛 정 땜에 한다 했다면
그건 존나 거짓말
난 필요악이야
날 싫어한다 해도
넌 계속 다 보고 있잖아
날 미워하지만
난 뒤로 가지 않네
절대로 그건 더 비참해
착한 척하는 놈들보다
훨씬 낫지 be honest
솔직한 게 죄라면
난 하나도 안 미안해
알고 있어 넌 아직도
내가 망하길 바라

뒷머릴 만지며
허수아비처럼 뭔가 어색한 듯이
니 앞에 서 있어
너는 놀래지 말라며
그때 셋이 만난 날 번홀 주고받았다며
이제야 내게 말해 버려 후련하다면서
너희 둘은 서로 손을 꼭 붙잡고 있어
잘 어울리냐고
어 되게 잘 어울려
오늘은 내가 살게 진짜 축하해
살다 보니 이런 일도 저런 일도 있지만
이건 몰랐어
너네 진짜 너무해 나 깜박 속았어
나도 속이고 있지 너희 둘 앞에서
아무렇지 않은 척해 너희 앞에서
어제까진 너무 설레이는 사이에서
이제 그냥 친한 친구로
나 홀로 그냥 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
우린 같은 곳에 항상 모여
바쁠 때는 간단히
술 한잔하고 헤어지고 다시 또
심심하다 싶음 다시 또 모여 만나지
우울할 때 위로해 신날 때는 함께
내 일인 듯 기뻐하고 매일 내일 없이 밤새
다음날 회사 지각했다 하면 널 놀리고
화가 나도 금세 풀려 우린 다시 모이죠
그래 우린 여전해
그냥 술을 마시다가 헤어지지 뻔해
그래 우린 안 변해
나만 가만있음 우리 사이는 안 변해
나 사실 안 편해
혹시 내 맘 들킬까 봐 계속 다릴 떠네
나 바보처럼 축하하는 척을 해
축하해 기분이다 내가 쏠게
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
다시 집으로
축복하고 싶어 나도
근데 나 너무 아퍼
셋이 묶인 악연
이건 나만 알어
우린 또
맨날 가던 곳에 앉아
매일 하던 얘길 하고
맨날 하던 얘길 하지
우린 새로운 걸 찾고 있었지만
이건 아냐 시간을 돌려줬음 해
그럴 수 있다면 너흴 모르는 곳까지
나는 돌아갈래
그럴 수 있다면 너흴 모르는 곳까지
나는 도망갈래

And when we French, refresh gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too

Why you gotta do
Oh my God Ponyboy
12 00 a m still haven't texted me back
I got a real bad feeling things are
falling off track
things are falling off track
I've got a scary intuition
that the things that I lack
Have got your phone on silent
let the screen turn black
ooh ooh ooh ooh
Pick up your phone
I wanna talk to ya
I wanna talk
'Cause I'm all alone
I can't think straight
I can't think straight
My heartbeat's beatin'
'cause I thought I knew ya
it can't stop
Keep leavin' me on read
you're going MIA MIA
Why you gotta do that
Why you gotta do
Everything you know I hate
I hit your phone up
but I don't get no luck
'Cause you're always going MIA
Why you gotta say those things
Things you know that I don't like
Why you gotta do that to me
My homie told me it was bad
saw the red flag
the red flag
I double text her
but I still don't get no text back
don't get no text back
She coming home late
she coming with a new sweater
Shoulda saw signs
shoulda knew better
I could smell on her breath that
she had just a mint
just had a mint
Not enough to
cover up an unfamiliar scent
unfamiliar scent
You took a piece of me
right from my heart
Got no time for games
baby we just can't restart
I'm falling to pieces
Broke like a bottle
But we can't just be friends
It's a hard pill to swallow
Now all of your girlfriends
yeah uh huh uh huh
Just say that I'm shallow
yeah uh huh uh huh
But we can't just reset
uh huh uh huh
You're a hard act to follow
I get it uh huh uh huh
Oh oh yuh
Why you gotta do that
Why you gotta do
Everything you know I hate
I hit your phone up
but I don't get no luck
'Cause you're always going MIA
Why you gotta say those things
Things you know that I don't like
Why you gotta do that to me
I ripped up our pictures
though memories remain
An accident unfortunate
too hard to explain
Like all good things
this must come to an end
All I ask is next time
don't go off with a friend
I'm falling to pieces
Broke like a bottle
But we can't just be friends
It's a hard pill to swallow
Now all of your girlfriends
Just say that I'm shallow
But we can't just reset
You're a hard act to follow
oh oh yuh
Why you gotta do that
Why you gotta do
why you gotta do
Everything you know I hate
Everything you know I hate
I hit your phone up
but I don't get no luck
hit your phone up
'Cause you're always going MIA
Why you gotta say those things

나는 너를 훨씬 아끼지 babe
네가 원한다면 안 찰게
허세 따위는 안 통하니까
넌 정말 신기한 여자
나를 노력하게 만드니까
baby oh yeah
우리 둘의 밤을 상상했어
girl all night
몸에 타투를 보여줘
If it's alright
Girl 말해줘 네 마음 바로 지금
Baby 같이 올라가자 하늘 위로
All I wanna do is kick it with you
너의 몸매 그린 것만 같아 미술
오늘 의상처럼 네 마음도 씨쓰루
All I wanna do is kick it with you
어떡해 내 맘에 네가 들어오려 해
쉽게 빠질까 봐 위험해 보여
조심하려 할 때
움직여지지 않아
날 보는 네 시선이 내 몸을 감아
하나로 얽혀 너와 나
이제부턴 아무도 풀지 못해
뻔하지 않게 우연같이 만나 baby
서로에게 녹아들어
오늘밤 우리 기분은 저 하늘 구름 위
네 몸에 타투를 보여줘
이미 내 맘은 준비되어있어
Boy 말할게 내 마음 바로 지금
그래 같이 올라가자 하늘 위로
All I wanna do is kick it with you
네가 원한대로 내 대답은 Me too
이제부터 널 부르게 해줘 My boo
All I wanna do is kick it with you
내가 하고 싶은 모든 것 뒤엔
너와 함께 가 생략 되어 있지
요즘 인기 많은
교포오빠들과는 달라
김치 향기가 배어있지
덕분에 난 몰아 호랑이
택 달린 옷은 방에 쌓여가고 있어
밤에 입어 편하게
이젠 너는 나 나는 너로 구분 짓고
ALL I WANNA DO 라고 말해 편하게
너의 옆자리를 상상할 거고
그곳에는 내가 있게 될 거야
그리고 너에 대해 장담하건대
뭐든 할 수 있을 거라고 믿게 될 거야
Girl 말해줘 네 마음 바로 지금
Baby 같이 올라가자 하늘 위로
All I wanna do is kick it with you

Look nobody likes a fake h*e
B*tch love who I am
and not my bankroll
But I'm up
so that is not realistic
Shoot my shot
then I check the ballistics
Shoot my shot
then I’m on to the next one
Shoot my shot no stress
when I’m sexing
These h*es don’t respect my grind
She calling rain checks
don’t respect my time
Calling rainchecks
cause she know she a dime ‘
I make that b*tch bounce
I’m Bank of America
I got Sydney and Erica
I got Stacy in Maryland
I got plenty of hoes
don’t make me
make no comparison
I should embarrass these hoes
But Imma calm back down
Got the Maybach ask her
how she got act now
Cause when I used
to shoot my shot you a matrix
Now you reappear but I hate tricks
Look nobody likes a fake h*e
B*tch love who I am
and not my bankroll
But Im up
so that is not realistic
Shoot my shot
then I check the ballistics
Shoot my shot
then I’m on to the next one
Shoot my shot no stress

Know how to keep me flowing
When you hit me, I be going through it
I think I'm giving too much, even though I shouldn't
Gamble all my time, I don't play with it
Yeah, I'll roll the dice on you, baby
I hit a seven, you can swing my way
And while you're at it, you can get a little taste

[Refrain: Joyce Wrice]
But you know that's not all I want
Them late nights with you ain't enough
How does everything change when I say I want ya?
We be going back and forth
Acting like you so unsure
But everytime you're here, it's like I'm all yours

[Chorus: Joyce Wrice]
I'm usually quick to cut it off, but with you I can't choose (Got me on one)
If I switch it up fast on you, baby, you lose (Got mе on one)
But I really wanted that, what's a girl to do, yеah (We on one)
Sometimes I want to cut it off, but with you I can't choose
You got me on one
You got me on one

[Verse 2: Joyce Wrice]
You either want it all or you don't want nothing, baby
You ain't gon' have me at it going crazy
'Cause he know it been good on this sight
Let's just put it all together and get it right

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Black Russians in Azur, yo, that's what I'm on
Hundred texts, she do the fool when I don't call the phone
Bitch trip, click, click, you get the dial tone
Relaxed on the tracks, I don't rap, I get my style on
The last nigga hit you and quit you, now you can't find holmes
Had your mind blown, nigga diamonds at you like rhinestones
Fuck the runway, I'm runnin' hoes, Fashion Week
French bitch from Ivory Coast, pussy magnifique
Sneaky link, I need a freak like Adina Howard
Not a goofy bitch that be checkin' phones while I'm in the shower
Police got behind us so I took the chopper, she took the powder
Lawyer got my bail, I'll be on the streets in a couple hours
Ride for me, the game dirty but my heart pure
Had to test the waters, I couldn't swim, I was unsure
Undecided with this shit, I'm in disguises when I hit
Sometimes I have to tell a lie to keep my biz, what's up?

[Chorus: Joyce Wrice & Freddie Gibbs]
I'm usually quick to cut it off, but with you I can't choose (Baby, baby, what's up?)
If I switch it up fast on you, baby, you lose
But I really wanted that, what's a girl to do, yeah
Sometimes I want to cut it off, but with you I can't choose

You got me on one

I'm missing your face on my phone
I'm like wait wait (Wait, wait)

Dial up my phone, am I special? Yeah

Don't play games, yeah
Mind spinning 'round, beyblades on me
I be on grey lowkey, quick vacay lowkey
I be on poolside, woozah

Dancing alone in my room
And I'm picking up the petals of the flowers that you left me
Now I think it's 'bout a quarter past noon
And I'm still in my pajamas snapping like I'm a piranha

Remember all the studying I do in my high school?
And if I have a party, you're invited 'cause you're cool

English class, I learned how to use commas
Grew a bit older now I can't use commas
Blue dollars I swapped for the red I'm too stylish
Protect myself, surrounded by the shield
Like canned food products
All my life, never have school problems
Now the whole game like a food chart, and they got a section
For nеw Madonnas and new pajamas
Rappers be sleeping in thе fish section there's new piranhas
Bite your whole sound like Shazam
I shocked the newcomers
I am not a doctor, I can't save this
Even money, I buy the store my clothes replaced it
Seen a hundred laid on my bedside
Know I'm not a wave, but I said bye, to old habits
Ledge high, I'm outstanding, high standards
You weak rappers can't stand right
You know my nan tight
She prayin' every damn night for me
She prayin' every damn night for me
Every damn night for me
I don't need fortune cookies to tell me a message
I just be faker than a plastic obsession
I make the bank from expressions
I learned a lot from a lessons
That my grandparents were stressing me about
I don't need weapons to spit out the rounds
The world round filled with magazines
Cover books don't feature Asians with hella dreams
I'm pissed off, I'm pissed off, yeah
I'm pissed off, I'm pissed off, yeah

Waiting for the rising heart
Crashing down
Your all
Feels so unusual
I'm crying out to

[Verse 2: Warren Hue]
Ay
Your chopsticks for the paper
My chopsticks gave us power
I'll bow down, but I'll bow when the chop hit on your temple
My temple stands on respect
Your temple used for the net
Your temple used for the clout
Your temple hangs around clowns (Woah, woah, woah)
My temple hangs around clouds
88, that's the set I rep' everywhere is a set for you
Get your clothes and get dressed
Ay
You an actor, you a phony
I'm a champion with some trophies
I'll grab the mic so you know me
In the studio, feel like I'm sitting down on some coach seats
I'm by my lonely
""You're the best,"" better show me
Your Louis Vuitton for showpiece
My Louis fit on me, cozy, I go deep

get to you

Is where I want to stay

I don't wanna write another sad song
I don't wanna cry about some guy who didn't care enough

They always give the same damn look and say the same thing
Jordy, promise that someday you'll find the one
Then why's it gotta be so fucking hard to fall in love

They always say it's them and not me
So why's it gotta hurt when they leave

Gettin' kinda used to the attention
But then you had to go and throw me right into the friendzone, wait, no
Can't they find someone who wants me more
Is it too much just to ask to be adored

Why I always go ahead and choose
The ones who got commitment issues
Damn

But you
Still haven't replied
Best to forget
‘Cause you
Don't invest the time
Get out of my mind
Get out
You’re messing with my head
‘Cause I wait for you
Maybe I've misread
all the things you do
Looking for a reason to stay
Why can't I walk away
Walk away
Away from you
Try to decide
Could you
Say where this is going
I notice
Everytime I make
Up my mind
You find a way to
get back into my life
Get out of my life
Get out

Walk away
Away from you
Why can't I walk away
Walk away
Away from you
Is something I want
But if you don't feel the same way
then tell me
‘Cause it's nothing I want
If I'm alone in this
Your messing with my head
‘Cause I wait for you
Maybe I've misread
all the things you do
Looking for a reason to stay
Why can't I walk away

생각보다는 멀쩡해 보이는 네가 미워 서
일부러 엇나가 더
이건 둘 다 원하던 그림은 아니지만
어쩔 수 없다고
말하던 너를 뒤로하고서
가야겠지 결국 약속 못 지켜

돌아가려 해도 갈 수 없는 밤이었어
꿈이었어 모든 게 꿈이었어
잠깐 악몽이라 생각하고 넘겼었어
가지 마 가지 마 오늘 밤은 두고 가지 마
담지마 담지마 이 노래를 귀에 담지마

꽤나 짧은 순간이기에
We riding ‘til end of the summer
Just wanna keep us forever
전보다 원해 두 배로 난
Cause baby our time is
still ticking now
Come over 이 밤에 내가 널
따로 부르지 않게
그때 마침 나의 맘이
널 가만히 놔두질 않네
Just hold on me
Baby cause I'm in love with you
I'll never lie to you
Cause I'm in love with you
We've been through this
난 다시 설레
더 원한 걸 말해 Then I will say so
또 잊혀지지 않게
네게 스며들고 있지
물들고 있지
So take me back to day one 난 홀로
왔던 길을 돌아 네게 홀로
또 네게 가는 길 난 스며들고 있지
물들고 있지
더위는 싫지만 난 왠지 아쉬워
이 여름이 지나고 계절이 바뀌면
서운할 것 같아
난 더 많은 날을 너와
함께하지 못한 거 나 혼자만 그럴까
얼마 남지 않았어
Before the summer's over
둘만의 시간을 원해 난 너를 좀 더
느끼고파 Imma leave the door open
so come through
아무거나 입어 상관없어 옷은
준빈 내가 할 테니까 오면 돼 일단
네 favorite wine으로 채운
두 개의 잔
너를 위해 비워놨어 내일은 싹
우린 할 이야기가 많잖아
Let's not waste time
이 계절이 가기 전에 널 더 많이
느낄래 너만이 숨 쉬게 해 나를
난 아직 보낼 준비가 안 됐어
이 여름
함께 하고 싶은 게 더 있거든
We've been through this
난 다시 설레
더 원한 걸 말해 Then I will say so
또 잊혀지지 않게
네게 스며들고 있지
물들고 있지
So take me back to day one 난 홀로
왔던 길을 돌아 네게 홀로
또 네게 가는 길 난 스며들고 있지
물들고 있지
이번 여름에 나 누군가가 필요해
우릴 괴롭히는 과거들은 뒤로해
결국은 돌고 돌아 너에게로
다시 시작하자 처음부터 새로
안녕하세요 처음 뵙겠습니다
실례지만 네 맘을 뺐겠습니다
Don't laugh at me
cuz I'm in love with you
네가 너무 웃어서 내가 웃긴 놈인 줄
사실 너도 좋아하고 있던 거야
계속 웃던 게 내가 웃겨서가
아니라 내가 너무 좋아서였던 거야
안 그래도 더운
이번 여름 뜨겁겠구나
You and I can make it right
You know we're the best team right
로코 최고의 캐스팅 right
이번 여름 그리고 그다음 여름
그다음 여름에도 Let's be together
We've been through this
난 다시 설레
더 원한 걸 말해 Then I will say so
또 잊혀지지 않게
네게 스며들고 있지
물들고 있지
So take me back to day one 난 홀로
왔던 길을 돌아 네게 홀로
또 네게 가는 길 난 스며들고 있지
물들고 있지

남겨 진 텅빈 아침
혼자 인것 같았지

자유로워 좋았어 난 근데
아무것도 할수 없네
멍청 해져 가네
나비 처럼 날아
너는 벌처럼 스쳐 지나가네

밤새놀고 와도 빈 내 침대가 날 반겨
이제 널 만나는 방법
안주 없이 삼키면
절로 눈이 감겨
어김없이 와준 너
꿈에서만 안겨
꿈에선 잘 담기던 말이
더는 닿지도 못하니
나는 rollin'
더 많은 술 꺼내

움직여져 두 배속으로

볼 수 없으니까 찢어지고
쓰린 속을 술로 소독
온종일 뜯긴 머린 몽롱
다음날 아침에 폰을 보면
빼곡 하지 발신 목록

Every morning 울린
Beep beep beep beep 소리
귀에 윙윙윙 맴도는
나를 재촉하던 모닝콜 없이 일어나
Cheese cake 한 입
유리컵 한가득
내린 커피 한 잔
아이스로 할래 아주 여유롭게
문득 시곌 보니
벌써 시간은 열두시
그래도 아주 느긋해
그리곤 하품 한 번
한껏 기지개도 켜고
생각해 오늘 뭐 할까
창문 너머 계절에 시선이 닿은 그 순간
쏟아지는 햇살 내 맘을 두드려
내게 손짓하는 싱그러운 바람 타고서
떠나볼래 When the weekend comes

하루쯤 세상의 얘길 무시한 채
내가 나의 하루를 조립해 보려 해
더는 no no stress 고민 안 할래
Move it right left right 내 맘대로
가본 적도 없는 길 뭐가 있든지
I don’t need a map
when I roll the streets
이어 가보는 이윤 for a little fun
계속 up up up 좀 더 올라가
한쪽 길모퉁이 따라 맘대로 자라난
조그만 이름 모를 꽃
한참을 바라보다 뜨거운 햇살을 피해
벤치에 잠깐 앉아 봐
느려지는 걸음 그림자의 속도를 따라
함께 걷는 태양과 발을 맞추고
뒤이을 달빛을 따라 돌아오고 싶은 걸
떠나볼래 When the weekend comes
I can do whatever I want
바람 따라 흩어진 cloud
더 자유롭게 we can go
아무 계획이 없어서 완벽한 plan
우연히 찾아낸 secret place
그곳에 두고 와 나만의 작은 짐
골목길 끝을 돌아 만나게 될
기분 좋은 surprise 또 설렘
두근두근 온종일
고소한 향기의 coffee shop
눈에 들어오는 예쁜 옷
Do it for the weekend
do it for the weekend
맘에 들어오는 걸 더는 망설이긴 싫은 걸

니가 발을 딛는 곳마다
내가 있을 거라고 나는 말했지
그림자가 지는 곳에 너의 마음이
가라앉기도 전에 나는 말을 건네지
우리 그냥 아무것도 하지 말자
우리 그래 아무것도 하지 말자
니가 바라던 내가 바랬던
도시의 밤은 독해
내가 마셨던 오늘의 술은 또
너의 머릿결을 통해
나쁜 꿈은 꾸지않게
너의 머릴 감싸줄게
다른 생각나지 않게
너의 몸을 감싸줄게

창문을 열어놓고
니 향기에 젖은 채로
잠이 들고파
마침 바람이 시원하게 불어오고
너의 귓가에 아름다운 선율이 스쳐
너와의 아침은
소음마저 아름다울 거야
풍경이 바뀌고
난 식탁에 앉아 꿈을 꿀 거야
이대로 그냥 다시
밤이 오길 나는 원해
넌 그대로 좋은 날이기에
다시 한번 내게 더 안겨주길 바래
널 어떤 말로 담을 수 있을까
내 맘은 너무 깊어
너의 마음 안에 차오를 수 있을까
난 너로 인해 살아가라며
너의 맘을 안을게
넌 미소 짓고 말하네
나도 너와 같은 마음인걸
방 안에서 누워
창문을 열어놓고
니 향기에 젖은 채로
잠이 들고파
마침 바람이 시원하게 불어오고
너의 귓가에 아름다운 선율이 스쳐
나는 너의 노래가 되어
언제든지 너의 귓가에
잠에 들기 전까지 남아있을 거야
나는 너의 노래가 되어
언제든지 너의 귓가에
잠에 들기 전까지

Put a quarter Xan

I throw a bag

I was fine
Just to get you out my mind
for an evening (For an evening)
I used to wish
you would never find the one
But it's good to see you loved,
let's call it even
You're holding someone close
Should hurt, somehow it don't
I guess that's how I know
I've finally let you go

Never thought I'd be happy
to see you do the things we do
With somebody else, it's like

Oh, I never thought I'd be happy
to see you with somebody new
So many nights of barely sleeping
Wide awake and dreaming
I wanted you back
(I wanted you back)
It's clear we're good
without each other
Dancing with another
It's better like that

그래 아마 한참 전부터 너는
우리보단 너를 더 생각했어
더 어색해져 가는 둘의 시간 속엔
아무것도 할 수 없어
네 탓밖에 못한
내 탓도 있어 그동안
수많은 말을 내뱉곤
무책임하게 돌아서고는 난
보여 네 두 눈에서
우리의 끝이 희미하게

People like to talk nonsense
And only you catch my attention

After the party
Don't ask me about my ex
Today he'll be my dinner.

I love the way you despair

Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave ?

Bite me like that again
You hid the bullet in the sand
Do it like me
Now you choose to trigger or stay

I heard u killed me a hundred times in your dreams
That's funny. You can't even touch me anyways
Or do you want to bite my lips and taste my blood?
Come be dirty with me

This is why I like you
good boy
You sell smiles.
A boy who pretends to be sincere and kind
Clothed with hypocrisy
I'm gonna tear it.
Welcome to its collapse.

Already won the lottery
Don't need no diamonds
you're my rock
And I'm okay with a Ring Pop
And we'll never afford a Picasso

Huh

[Verse 1: Drew Love]
Keep bringin' up all the lies that I told you
Got me walking 'round like the world on my shoulders
Been too long, been ignorin' the signs
Feels like I'm just goin' along for the ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't pretend like somethin' ain't wrong
Should be old enough, we should know
Girl, I can't put up with no more
I'm losing focus
Now my friends are askin', ""What's wrong?""
Girl, we've been together so long
Gotta get this under control

[Chorus: Drew Love]
You got me losin' my focus, don't know what you do to me
You got me drinkin' a lot, hopin' it might go away
I'm slowly losin' my passion for all the important things
You got me losin' my focus, don't know what happened to me

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uh, yeah, look
I'm bad at guessin', but let me guess
You bad at tеxtin' though, you have a right every night
I writе a thousand letters that I never take to you
That's just the way I manifest the blessings
And the energy I'm tryna bring to you
One day, I'd like to share a sundae
And we can do a lot by doing absolutely nothing
I'm smilin' too hard, nah, you don't be tryin' too hard
Sometimes I look at the sky and think how fire you are
Look, Mother Nature, God, who has Wale become?
Told them bitches, ""Take a hike,"" now we takin' nature walks
I ain't tryna make a wife, I ain't tryna make it forced
I ain't tryna let my ego make you be my greatest loss
Uh, lavender in the blunt
Call me when you get up, you be raspy, I be in love
Half of these niggas textin' see half what you really are
I happen to see you clear, so sadly I'm sayin', ""Nah""
My focus is gone, gone

[Chorus: Drew Love]
You got me losin' my focus, don't know what you do to me
You got me drinkin' a lot, hopin' it might go away
I'm slowly losin' my passion for all the important things
You got me losin' my focus, don't know what happened to me
You got me losin' my focus, don't know what you do to me
You got me drinkin' a lot, hopin' it might go away

I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga

I don't give a damn if a nigga
said he knew me
Grew up with no father
so nobody ever son me
My flow too sick
Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that
nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never
making money
Well this the life
we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a
Queens Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me
pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding

Don't wanna lose
I remember nights
and the parties with you
You'd look at me like
there's no one else in the room
How did we let it go
And how do we get back to that
We should be alone
making love on the roof
Just lying in my arms looking up
at the moon
How did we let it go
And how do we get back to that

The only ones I wanna see
Your blue eyes
But they're not staring back at me

When the bottle's done
you pull me closer
You're saying all the things
that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me

Why is it so different when we wake up
Same lips same kiss
but not the same touch
Don't you know that you're doing
just enough but not enough
But I know what's next
and I want so much
Up in the clouds
yeah you know
how to make me want you
When we come down
oh I know yeah I know it's over

힘차게 흔들어 놓은

다시 돌아온 여름인데도
네가 인스타그램에
올린 사진도 전부 다 봤지
날 보고 말한 것 같아
혼자 또 착각하지
don't stop 너를 사랑하는 걸
아직 그만둘 수가 없어 다시 받아줘
이제 와서 다시 사랑해 girl 이란 말이
너무 우습게도 느껴질지도 몰라
I wanna stay with you

난 아무래도 난
나를 위해 날 너에게서 떼어내
네가 없으니
전부 낯선 것만 같아
그만 멀어져
This night I'm about to die
Cause my feelin’s slowly
killing me
외로움 속에서 발버둥 치다
지난 기억들이 내겐 모두
익숙했던 것처럼
어떻게든 살면 살아지겠지

지긋이 보네 요즘에
곡에 대한 부담 또 미래에
고스란히 맺혀 널 대할 때
서로 불안해할 걸 잘 알아
전부 너라서
모든 게 너라서
가득 담았어
너인 것 같아서
전부 너라서
모든 게 너라서
마음을 다했어
너인 걸 알아서
기대만 하게 해 미안해
내 마음을 조금 떼어 들려줄 때
애써 반응을 더 할 때엔
마냥 작아지는 게
난 가진 게 이거 단 하난데
이 목소리 말고는 보여줄 게
없는 걸 알아서
옆에 있는 널 볼 땐
가끔 나만 생각할래
믿어 우릴 이어준단 걸

I likе to say, ""What if?"", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе on to somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip-gloss, hickeys too, huh

Push your limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged it, don't need
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught creepin' with your friend
You ain't even half man lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag for the break, you know that
Control don't slow the pace, if I pull back
All this ass for real (Ahh)

따듯한 햇살로
난 널 지켜줄게 매일
너의 모든 시간 속에 내가 함께할게
오직 너를 위한 소중한 꿈을 담아
밝게 빛나는 별이 되어

네가 걸어가는 그 길 따라
수많은 별이 되어 비춰줄게
눈부시게 또 아름답게

세월이 흐른대도
시간이 지나도
언제나 널 사랑할게
영원히 너만을 빛나게
내가 비춰줄게 매일
길고 긴 시간 속에서
찾아올 끝에도
너를 사랑할게 매일

Wrapped in your skin
I got nowhere to go
Easy to hold
I've held this feelin
so deep in my bones
Fears I keep fighting
you washed them away
Lose track of time
But I won't forget these days
Spend hours lyin in vibes
And we ride it till the morning
You hit me like a wave wave
Crashin on me when we lay
Changin up my ways ways
So quick to leave now I stay
Can't see the surface no more
Far from the shore
Swimmin in your waters for more
You hit like a wave wave
Crashin on me when we lay
I can feel the sun rising
It's painting our bodies
in orange and gold
You got me faded
Not used to fallin
but you got me all in
Oh and these fears
I keep fighting
you washed them away
Lose track of time
But I won't forget these days
Spend hours lyin in vibes
And we ride it till the morning
You hit me like a wave wave
Crashin on me when we lay

Friday nights
were the wild ones
We'd be wasted
dancing down the grocery aisles
on a night like this
Night like this
Now every night's like this
Eating my dinner alone in the car
by the street lights
Kneeling on bathroom floors
ripping my cheap tights
Kissing his cigarette breath
and it's sweet right
That's that shit they sell you
This is why they tell you
Love sucks
But not as much as being this alone
Love sucks
But nothing's worse than
knowing that you're gone
So I'll take another warm shot
try and numb the hurt
Watch another ted talk
all I ever learn is lovе sucks
But hey if you're not busy
I'm five minutеs from your place
are you home
Is it too late
Was just thinking that
the weather on our first date
Was a night like this
night like this
I miss nights like this
I'm sorry for being so forward
but I just can't help it
And maybe writing
this song is just selfish
But holding it in has been hellish
So when you go to Hell too
I don't need to tell you
Love sucks
But not as much as being this alone
Love sucks
But nothing's worse than
knowing that you're gone
So I'll take another warm shot
try and numb the hurt
Watch another ted talk

I'm five minutes from your place
are you home
Know I shouldn't ask you
Are you home

Are you home
I kinda wanna ask you

Without breaking it all apart
And I don't know
which words are better
Or if I should even tell her
I fell in love with my best friend
I fell in love
And that's all
she needs to know ooh
She needs to know
Oh I fell in love
And that's all
she needs to know
That's all
that's all you need to know

꽤 오래되었죠

Since I let it all go

다 내려놓은지

Me and my thoughts

생각이 많아서

Kept me going way too slow

자꾸 머뭇거렸어요

But it feels like destiny

하지만 운명인 것 같아요

And I couldn’t be happier to meet you

그대를 만난 게 더 없이 행복해

Everything you and I could be

우리 사이의 모든 일들이

Could this be our love story?

사랑 이야기가 될 수 있을까요?



And when I saw you standing there

그대가 거기 서 있을 때

You were the only source of light

오직 당신에게만 빛이 났어요

I wonder if this is our night

오늘밤 우리가 어떻게 될지 궁금해요



If we get away, could we be like that?

만약 함께 떠난다면 우리에게 사랑이 올까요?

Sometime if you want me like that

언젠가 그대가 원한다면

Only we’ve been seeing what we need my bad

우리에게 필요한 건 우리만 아니까

If you’re sober I’ll feel fine

그대가 취하지 않았다면 난 괜찮을 거예요



If we get away, could we be like that?

Sometime if you want me like that

If you’re sober I’ll feel fine

그대가 취하지 않았다면 난 괜찮을 거예요



Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (신호를 줘요)

Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (내가 알 수 있도록)

Oh oh oh oh

It's over and over it’s over

우리에게 시간이 얼마 없어요

Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (신호를 줘요)

Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (내가 알 수 있도록)

Oh oh oh oh

It's over and over it’s over

우리에게 시간이 얼마 없어요



Oh no if this is real then

지금이 꿈이 아니라면

Let's leave through the front door

우리 함께 문 밖으로 나가요

I think I need a moment with you

나는 그대와 함께 할 시간이 필요해

We're stepping outside

밖으로 걸어가

And sparks they fly

불꽃이 그대 눈 속에서

I look in your eyes

춤을 추는 걸 바라볼 거예요

And I kiss your lips good bye

그리고는 입맞춤과 함께 우리는 헤어지겠죠



If we get away, could we be like that?

만약 함께 떠난다면 우리에게 사랑이 올까요?

Sometime if you want me like that

Something good

오늘밤 무언가 좋은 일이

Might happen to us tonight

우리에게 일어날지도 몰라요

Love this mood

이런 느낌이 좋아요

Feels like luck is on my side

나 오늘 꽤 운이 좋은 것 같아요

It’s been so long since

얼마만인지 모르겠어요

I had the time of my life

내 삶에 이런 시간이 찾아온 게

If I could yeah I would

할 수만 있다면

Buy us some more time

우리를 위한 시간을 더 사두고 싶어요



If we get away, could we be like that?

만약 함께 떠난다면 우리에게 사랑이 올까요?

Sometime if you want me like that

언젠가 그대가 원한다면

Only we’ve been seeing what we need my bad

우리에게 필요한 건 우리만 아니까

If you’re sober I’ll feel fine

그대가 취하지 않았다면 난 괜찮을 거예요

I've ever dreamed about
So how do I tell her this then
Without breaking it all apart
And I don't know
which words are better
Or if I should even tell her
I fell in love with my best friend
And that's all she needs to know
So hard and
I can't get this off my chest
Three words
why the hell can't I pick them next
I'll wait afraid
I'ma make a mess of this
So I count the times that
I've tried to speak
To her the reason that
I can't sleep
Would all my sorrow
and my worriеs be gone
She knows what
shе's talking 'bout
My where and whats
and roundabouts
So why I can't even say hey
I fell in love with my best friend

So how do I tell her this then
Without breaking it all apart
And I don't know

Or if I should even tell her

And that's all she needs to know
Safe to say that
I know them well
Her mom her dad
and all of her friends
And when no one can
read her face I can
She knows everything 'bout me
My deepest insecurities
But still I can't even say hey
I fell in love with my best friend

to the part with all the ad-libs
It really had a lot of meaning
I really wish
that you could hear it
Now there's no point
in finishing I lost the spirit
Keep it in my drafts
then one day it'll disappear and

See me out in the same place

Order the same drinks
Said all the same things

충분히 대답이 될 것만 같네요
이렇게 기다리고 기다리고
기다리면 내게 돌아올까 봐
추억을 안고 살아도
다시 한 번만 더 보고 싶어
사랑하고 사랑하고 사랑해서
잊을 수가 없어서
많이 힘이 드네요
아픈 그리운 내 사랑아
아직도 잊혀지지 않네요
사랑했던 우리 추억이
오늘도 너무 그리워
한번 지나간
우리의 시간들은 두 번 다시
절대로 돌아오지 않을 테지만
이렇게 기다리고 기다리고
기다리면 내게 돌아올까 봐
추억을 안고 살아도
다시 한 번만 더 보고 싶어
사랑하고 사랑하고 사랑해서
잊을 수가 없어서
많이 힘이 드네요
아픈 그리운 내 사랑아
꿈에서라도 너를 매일매일
보고 싶은 내 맘을
너는 이런 나를 벌써 잊었을까
한 번만 다시 한 번만 더 볼 수 있다면
꿈에서라도 정말 행복할 텐데
이렇게 아파하고 슬퍼하고
힘들어도 달라 질건없는데
또 하루를 살아가는게
왜 이렇게 많이 힘이들까
그리워도 외로워도
참아야돼 잊혀 질수 있도록

꽤 오래되었죠

Since I let it all go

다 내려놓은지

Me and my thoughts

생각이 많아서

Kept me going way too slow

자꾸 머뭇거렸어요

But it feels like destiny

하지만 운명인 것 같아요

And I couldn’t be happier to meet you

그대를 만난 게 더 없이 행복해

Everything you and I could be

우리 사이의 모든 일들이

Could this be our love story?

사랑 이야기가 될 수 있을까요?



And when I saw you standing there

그대가 거기 서 있을 때

You were the only source of light

오직 당신에게만 빛이 났어요

I wonder if this is our night

오늘밤 우리가 어떻게 될지 궁금해요



If we get away, could we be like that?

만약 함께 떠난다면 우리에게 사랑이 올까요?

Sometime if you want me like that

언젠가 그대가 원한다면

Only we’ve been seeing what we need my bad

우리에게 필요한 건 우리만 아니까

If you’re sober I’ll feel fine

그대가 취하지 않았다면 난 괜찮을 거예요



If we get away, could we be like that?

만약 함께 떠난다면 우리에게 사랑이 올까요?

Sometime if you want me like that

언젠가 그대가 원한다면

Only we’ve been seeing what we need my bad

우리에게 필요한 건 우리만 아니까

If you’re sober I’ll feel fine

그대가 취하지 않았다면 난 괜찮을 거예요



Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (신호를 줘요)

Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (내가 알 수 있도록)

Oh oh oh oh

It's over and over it’s over

우리에게 시간이 얼마 없어요

Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (신호를 줘요)

Oh oh oh oh (give it to me)

오 오 오 오 (내가 알 수 있도록)

Oh oh oh oh

It's over and over it’s over

우리에게 시간이 얼마 없어요



Oh no if this is real then

지금이 꿈이 아니라면

Let's leave through the front door

우리 함께 문 밖으로 나가요

I think I need a moment with you

나는 그대와 함께 할 시간이 필요해

We're stepping outside

밖으로 걸어가

And sparks they fly

불꽃이 그대 눈 속에서

I look in your eyes

춤을 추는 걸 바라볼 거예요

And I kiss your lips good bye

그리고는 입맞춤과 함께 우리는 헤어지겠죠



If we get away, could we be like that?

좋은 차
좋은 낮
그만
Good time
Good vibe
Bad thing
나에겐 없는걸
그때 우리 대화도
서로 했던 모진 말들과
등 돌렸던 우리 사이도
다 내게 던지고
Good night

Look around girl
내가 옆에 있는데
너는 모른 체 지나가
아픈 밤은 더 기나 봐
더 잠 못 드는 밤

이젠 현실과 싸워 늘어나 상처

쓰러지지 않어 난 섀도우 박서

일어서야 해 심판이 10초 새기 전에
먹여야 돼 한방 기회들을 노려

말했잖아 아까 패배자로 살 바에는
죽음을 달라 벌처럼 날아

I could put a ring on your finger
before you change your mind yeah
Knew I was falling
when I looked inside your eyes
She said I know you are
but what am I
Tell me have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise
Kiss right through the night
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you 'til the mornin'
And if I said I'm fallin'
would you just reply
I know you are but what am I

Are you with me? Won't you give me just a sign tonight?
If you give me more than secrets, I'll be yours for life
I've been waiting, praying you don't keep these games going
All this time I played the fool and I just didn't know it

Every time I take you home
When I wake up, you're gone
Damn

You always play with, play with my emotions
You got me, and you know it
You got me running, running in slow-motion
So why you always playing, playing with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Play with my emotions

Do you love me, or just love to take my time up?
If you want me like I want you, make your mind up
Are you with me? Won't you give me just a sign tonight?
If you give me more than secrets, I'll be yours for life

You always play with, play with my emotions
You got me, and you know it
You got me running, running in slow-motion
So why you always playing, playing with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Play with my emotions

for sadness (Sadness)
Looked through
the basement and attic (Attic)
It must be weaved in my fabric

It's probably true but I'm sick

I woke up feeling like an asshole
Flipping through the channels
Looking for something that feels right
I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying ""Nevermind""
I wish that I could be solo
But God, I hate feeling so alone
My thoughts turn
into a pile of clothes

Though it took some time
to survive you
I’m better on the other side
I’m all good already
So moved on it’s scary
I'm not where you left me at all so
If you don't wanna see me
dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe
that anything could stop me
Don't don't don't
Don’t show up
don't come out
Don’t start caring
About me now
Walk away
You know how
Don’t start caring
About me now
'Bout me now 'bout me

to say the first goodbye
Had to love and
lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong
to know just what I like

I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time
I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one
that feels it all
Are you falling
Centre of attention
You know you can get
whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it baby
It's you in my reflection
Now I'm afraid of all
the things you could do to me
If I would've known it baby
I would've stayed at home
'cause I was always better alone
But when you said Hello
I knew it was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'cause now there
ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one
that could break my heart
Oh no I was always better alone
But when you said Hello
I knew it was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'cause now there
ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one
that could break my heart
I wonder when you go
if I stay on your mind
Two could play that game
but you win me every time
Everyone before you
was a waste of time
Yeah you got me

Oh lover
why you got me clobbered
Frustrated and bothered
Paranoid that
you’ll destroy my colour
And paint it cover it and fade it
Leave me looking jaded
Why do I still love you
when I hate this
Got me keeping quiet
But you know I wanna talk about it
I don’t wanna have to hide it
I need somebody to confide in
Don’t let me stow it away
‘Cause I can barely fight it
It’s a constant ache
when i’m reminded that
You never call my telephone
But you know we’re both alone
What is it you’re holding on to
Because there is something wrong
I understand that
you may never want me close
But understand that
I need you the most
I spread my love
Along your path so
Please tread softly
Please tell me
you won’t go stomping harshly
You don’t have to want me
But please tread softly
Softly

Oh karma
Why do I even bother
When you never wanna stick with me
Instead of choosing others to favour
You know I can’t hate her
For watching him go chase her
When nothing
he could do could ever phase her
Got me sick and tired
Of the sneaking and the lying
But god knows that i’m trying to stay
But she’s denying that
she ever fell in love
With the pages of his mind
But she didn’t wanna
be in his cages all the time
Forgive me if you find me
replaying it in my head
You saying what you said
Words I wish I never read
‘Cause I
I
I need you the most
I spread my love

Please tell me
you won’t go stomping harshly
You don’t have to want me

Oh no uh oh no uh oh no uh
Just please tread softly

Do you know the fight
To keep you by my side
This love will never change
But I just might go insane
Do you know me now
so I can see a smile
This love will never grow
But at least you will never know
I just wanna keep us close tonight
I just wanna keep us loving
right now

널 처음 만나 설렜었던 그날
유독 느리게 걸었던 너와 나
어색해하는 너를 봤을 때
궁금해 너는 알고 있는지
아직도 그때
너의 모습은 날 미소 짓게 해
Everytime I go inside your heart
너의 마음에 들어가면
난 아직도 설레 girl 넌 어때
If you feel the same
Everytime you come inside my heart
네가 마음에 들어오면
숨이 멎을듯해 boy 넌 어때
If you feel the same
기억나 모든 순간
처음 손잡을 때
떨렸던 내 맘이 전해질까 싶었어
사소한 걱정을 늘어놓고
세심한 고민까지 함께 나눌 때
너와의 따뜻했던
오늘이 내일 보다 난 소중해
너와 나의 시간 속에서
같은 곳을 향해 걸을 때
바랄게 없어 더 지금의 난
If you feel the same
내 마음이 you got me

I don't wanna say

Pulling up on the 1-5
Trying to get you off my mind
Been telling myself
that it's a waste of time
But maybe I'm dumb not to call
'Cause baby
living without you ain't right
From stumbling home after midnight
To seeing the same films
a hundred times
Yeah maybe it won't hurt to call
Oh yeah you gotta you gotta
You gotta admit
we were so dumb so dumb
And oh no baby
how did we how did we
How did we manage
to mess this up mess this up
I'm wide awake missing your face
Missing your taste
wishing you were lost with me
Now I'm driving your way

man I thought I was a genius
From the verses to the chorus
to the part with all the ad-libs
It really had a lot of meaning
I really wish
that you could hear it
Now there's no point
in finishing I lost the spirit
Keep it in my drafts
then one day it'll disappear and

Because there is something wrong

Why do I even bother
When you never wanna stick with me
Instead of choosing others to favour
You know I can’t hate her
For watching him go chase her
When nothing
he could do could ever phase her
Got me sick and tired
Of the sneaking and the lying
But god knows that i’m trying to stay
But she’s denying that
she ever fell in love
With the pages of his mind
But she didn’t wanna
be in his cages all the time
Forgive me if you find me
replaying it in my head

our love went cold

I'll never have enough of you
When you're around me
You make every passing moment new
And when I'm not with you
I know you'll still agree
I'll be the only one to love you
In my dreams

I can't stop looking into those eyes
I'm lost maybe I'm hypnotized
'Cause the way you look
With these pink skies
As the sun drifts away tonight
Just hold tight
'Cause when you're in my arms
It feels right
You know there ain't no place
I'd rather be

And it's a summer fling
But I've been hurt enough to know
I love you differently
I think I finally found someone
Who won't disagree
I'll be the only one
You'll keep loving in your dreams
Oh my I swear I can't stop looking
Into those eyes

Blur in the church for certain in the craft
Make it a market like it's done for certain
The days for reciting the life is the type one
Life is coming, second coming, shit to hit the
Drinks are kicking licks is thick with
This might be it the private shit, we're stuck in that, we're fighting it
so this is it, the only real way now
Kick the shit, my lips know this, they owned in the playground
Owned it in ways now, as lone as the greyhound
brushes in the grave now

In many ways the days already very lemonade
But chasing tomatoes tastes best, was always set in place
We were shorts, shout all our thoughts out
So for now we pull our all out, we talk loud
But means on the green team searching for better states
Loose at the seams and we're thirsty for lemonade
Can't stick to work, on the jukebox
No tight loonies, ropes like loonies, hopes they grow right through me

Don't mean to come off cold
I don't want to be alone

But life

Just seems to happen
right before my eyes
Before my eyes
'Cause I feel like I'm not there
'Cause my head is up somewhere
Far away from all my friends
I just want that back again
Oh I
Oh I
Try to be happy
but it's hard sometimes
Hard sometimes
I don't feel like myself and
I can't help being selfish
Sometimes
the pressure gets the best of me

생각에 생각을 생각하다보니
너의 생각에 대해 생각하게 돼
그 생각은 아프진 않을런지

이별이 아름다울 리가
앓는 소리하기 바빴던
나는 너의 아픔까진 미처 못봤다
잘 지내 행복하길 바란다는 말은 이제
할 필요도 없어 오히려 짐이 돼
그녈 괴롭히는 말일 뿐인데
내가 뭘 할 수 있는데
어쩌면 너를 생각하는 일도
더이상 내가 해야하는 일이 아닐 지도
너를 위한 이별이란 위선
현실이란 핑계로 도망친 겁쟁이일뿐
너의 밤은 이제 온전히 너의 것이야
너의 방에 놓인 자그마한 오브제보다
가치가 없어진 나란 존재는 그저 혼자
최대한 고요히 네게서 지워지고파
너의 밤엔 지금 너의 밤엔
얼마나 많은 상처들이 났을까
나도 이렇게 아픈데 여린 너가 걱정 돼
부디 오늘은 푹 잤음 해 my love

아름다운 건 늘 소중하고
잠시 머물다 아득히 멀어져도
늘 마주 보듯 평범한
일상을 채울 마음의 눈
그 안에 감춰둔 외로움도
잠시 머물 수 있게 해
그저 바라봐
부드러운 바람이 불면
마음을 열어 지나갈 하루야

진심이 담긴 마음이
시간이 지나 다시 기억할 수 있다면
말할 수 있을까
너도 행복했다고
너와 울고 같이 웃고
기대하고 아파했지
모든 걸 쏟고 사랑하고
마음이 가는 대로 있는 그대로
말하지 못할 고민거리

내 얘기 좀 들어봐 오 미란아
이 미련아 이 미련아
망할 미련아 잠시 내려가
내가 미안하니깐
그니깐
그땐 죽을만큼 사랑했잖아
오 미란아 별건 아냐
내가 취해서 그런거니깐
아 그리고 하나 더
우린 아마 운명이 아녔어
왜냐면 그때 보냈던 mail을 다시 보니깐
발송이 안됐더라고 5년뒤에 알았어
순간 진짜 너무 웃겨
나는 피식하고 웃었어
그리고 마지막에 너의 근황들을 봤지 난
feed 에는 이쁜 너의 옆엔 남자친구가
해외 나가 유학한단 소식들도 들었어
곧 결혼할 것 같던데
이건 널 위한 마지막 song
미란아 오 미란아
내 얘기 좀 들어봐 오 미란아
이 미련아 이 미련아
망할 미련아 잠시 내려가
내가 미안하니깐

너와 나 서로 피해가기 바쁘지 매번
우린 항상 그런식이었어
넌 자꾸 피하고서 내게 돌려 잘못
모든 문제의 원인이 거기 다 있는데
너와 같이 보던 영화 속에선

Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth

Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too

her nowhere good

And I don’t know what night it is

Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight

I’m faded so I bring someone home

I've tried to speak
To her the reason that
I can't sleep
Would all my sorrow
and my worriеs be gone
She knows what
shе's talking 'bout
My where and whats
and roundabouts
So why I can't even say hey
I fell in love with my best friend
She's all that
I've ever dreamed about
So how do I tell her this then
Without breaking it all apart
And I don't know
which words are better
Or if I should even tell her
I fell in love with my best friend
And that's all she needs to know
Safe to say that
I know them well
Her mom her dad
and all of her friends
And when no one can
read her face I can
She knows everything 'bout me
My deepest insecurities
But still I can't even say hey
I fell in love with my best friend
I fell in love
She's all that
I've ever dreamed about
So how do I tell her this then
How do I
Without breaking it all apart
And I don't know
which words are better
Or if I should even tell her
I fell in love with my best friend
I fell in love
And that's all
she needs to know ooh
She needs to know
Oh I fell in love
And that's all
she needs to know
That's all
that's all you need to know

memories for life

Instead complain about realities
Not by myself
just you and me all night

we used to go
Take me back to moments
that we made on our own
And just ride
come jump up
on my brand new bike
We'll go down to
that place that you like
And do the things that
we now look back as a memory
Tonight you can bring
your friends I don't mind
But leave all of
your problems behind
Into the place that we now
look back as a memory
I want to leave I have the mistake
Wish I could pack
my bags and move right back
So I can make new
memories for life
Back to my mom
back to my dad
I want the happiness
I knew I have
'Cause maybe then
we'd have another chance

But I know I could never be sick
Of all the times we spend together
It's always gonna be this way
We're running round just
like the kids we are
Maybe we're supposed
to take no precautions
Baby like there
ain't no other options oh
'Cause I can tell just
when we kiss it's hard
Not to think bout doing it forever
I couldn't just do it with whoever

for sadness (Sadness)
Looked through
the basement and attic (Attic)
It must be weaved in my fabric
but I feel nothing

It's probably true but I'm sick
And tired of feeling like this
I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying ""Nevermind""
I woke up feeling like an asshole
Flipping through the channels
Looking for something that feels right
I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying ""Nevermind""
I wish that I could be solo
But God, I hate feeling so alone
My thoughts turn
into a pile of clothes

Where things just happen so easy

Floating through the night
then drowning all day

Pretending I'm not anxious
Hide from friends
But opening up to strangers
I don't wanna be dramatic
Cause it's all in my mind

and they keep calling
My phone light up and I ignore it

Every night you probably
pray for this
But understand you ain't dealing

I be H-I-G-H maintenance
Now you see
why Saweetie don't play
with tricks
'Cos I be onto the next

Nah I'm all 'bout respect

I be running up a cheque
watch a bitch work
Try and keep up baby

everything i need

Eight months and six days later
And no one's asked me
how I'm doin' Doin'
I was kinda hopin' they would
And all your friends
still talk to me
But they choose their words
so carefully
Will I always be the enemy
Always be the enemy
I keep prayin' for a breakthrough
An explanation for
where I hurt you
Is it wrong for me to wonder
How you've been
How you've been
In my closet there's a letter
That I'll send
when things get better
Oh I hope that things get better
But until then
I don't want to think about you
More than I have to
More than I have to
Don't wanna miss you

when I'm tripping I see your face

while I'm sober
For the moment
I can only hope this lasts
'Cause when the high stops
then I know that you're gone
So stay and hold me
like a paper weight
Kiss me like it's all the same
Just lovers like we were
supposed to be
Oh as these shapes
and colours all start to fade
I can feel you slipping away
Just promise that
you'll wait right here for me
Until I find another dose
Won't make it on my own
I'm done carrying
the weight of the world
So heavy on my shoulders
I just wanna feel this love
Even if it's only when I'm
Tripping, I see your face

많이 본듯한데 해서
아 생각났어 너가 취했을 때
내게 전화 걸었던 그 날
너무 귀여워서 녹음을 했었고
너와 헤어지고나서
2년뒤에 군대가서 그때 file을 첨부해서
이때 너무 좋았잖아 미란아 들어봐 하며
메일 한통을 전송했어 맞아 but
답장이 안와서 조금 머쓱하긴 해도

아 그리고 하나 더
우린 아마 운명이 아녔어
왜냐면 그때 보냈던 mail을 다시 보니깐
발송이 안됐더라고 5년뒤에 알았어
순간 진짜 너무 웃겨
나는 피식하고 웃었어
그리고 마지막에 너의 근황들을 봤지 난
feed 에는 이쁜 너의 옆엔 남자친구가
해외 나가 유학한단 소식들도 들었어
곧 결혼할 것 같던데
이건 널 위한 마지막 song

어젯밤에 했던 말
머릿속에 남아
내려가 내 마음에 앉아
지긋이 보네 요즘에
곡에 대한 부담 또 미래에
고스란히 맺혀 널 대할 때
서로 불안해할 걸 잘 알아
전부 너라서
모든 게 너라서
가득 담았어
너인 것 같아서
전부 너라서
모든 게 너라서
마음을 다했어
너인 걸 알아서
기대만 하게 해 미안해
내 마음을 조금 떼어 들려줄 때
애써 반응을 더 할 때엔
마냥 작아지는 게
난 가진 게 이거 단 하난데
이 목소리 말고는 보여줄 게
없는 걸 알아서
옆에 있는 널 볼 땐
가끔 나만 생각할래
믿어 우릴 이어준단 걸
전부 너라서
모든 게 너라서
가득 담았어
너인 것 같아서
전부 너라서
모든 게 너라서
마음을 다했어
너인 걸 알아서

많은 계절 속에 폈던 그 꽃에 우리
작은 꽃잎이 돼서 남겨지고 싶어
내 하루 하룰 네 곁에
향기로 남겨둘 거야
이 선물 같은 일상들을 모두 다
내 하루 하룰 그렇게 다 담고 싶어
너에게 받았던 사랑
그 추억들 모두 다
너의 향기가 물들던 밤
별빛 아래서 함께 발맞추던 길
흩날리던 향기들 모두 모아
예쁜 꽃말이 돼서 남겨지고 싶어

네가 멀어질까 사실은 불안했나 봐
꼭 네게 하고 싶었던 그 말
나와 함께했던 수많은 순간

Close my eyes
and guess the flavors
I let you play all your games
'Cause you're a player
I let you lay on my chest
And talk about her
But that don't change
That my heart keeps beating louder
Straight to my face
And it don't feel right
This could be a thing
But you waste my time
Don't want to be a shoulder
Listen while you cry
'Cause I don't wanna know
Don't wanna hear 'bout
where you were last night
But you never even try to hide it
I like it better
when you leave me blind
Out of sight and out of mind
I should have left
Right when you said it
Felt like a fool
'cause I couldn't get it
Don't wanna hear 'bout
where you were last night
Out of sight and out my mind
Out of sight and out my mind

And I don't even blame you
'Cause the truth is
that I'm falling apart
And every second
I sit here and listen
I'm breaking my own heart

I just want you to want me
I don't mind just lie
I'm sick of the frontin'
You tell me the truth
And you let me down
I just don't know
what the game is now
Just lie just lie
Don't wanna hear about
where you were last night
But you don't even try to hide it
I like it better when you leave me
Out of sight and out of mind

you’ll destroy my colour
And paint it cover it and fade it

Why do I still love you
when I hate this
Got me keeping quiet
But you know I wanna talk about it
I don’t wanna have to hide it
I need somebody to confide in
Don’t let me stow it away
‘Cause I can barely fight it
It’s a constant ache
when i’m reminded that
You never call my telephone
But you know we’re both alone
What is it you’re holding on to
Because there is something wrong
I understand that
you may never want me close

Why do I even bother
When you never wanna stick with me
Instead of choosing others to favour
You know I can’t hate her
For watching him go chase her
When nothing
he could do could ever phase her
Got me sick and tired
Of the sneaking and the lying
But god knows that i’m trying to stay
But she’s denying that
she ever fell in love
With the pages of his mind
But she didn’t wanna
be in his cages all the time
Forgive me if you find me
replaying it in my head
You saying what you said
Words I wish I never read
‘Cause I

너무 귀여워서 녹음을 했었고

우린 아마 운명이 아녔어
왜냐면 그때 보냈던 mail을 다시 보니깐
발송이 안됐더라고 5년뒤에 알았어
순간 진짜 너무 웃겨
나는 피식하고 웃었어
그리고 마지막에 너의 근황들을 봤지 난
feed 에는 이쁜 너의 옆엔 남자친구가
해외 나가 유학한단 소식들도 들었어
곧 결혼할 것 같던데

두고 간 공허가 남았잖아
i'm sorry but i love you
여전히 남아있는 공허처럼
방안엔 네 흔적들은 아직 그대론데
나는 너 없는 공간에 혼자서
멍하니 또 하루를 낭비하고 있어 baby
너 없는 공간에 혼자서
멍하니 또 어질러진 감정을 살펴

혼자인 기분 어두운 내 방
내 얼굴을 환하게 하는 건
핸드폰의 조명뿐
그마저도 잠시 뿐인 점멸등
무표정으로 넘긴
타임라인 속 넘치는 말
언제 한 번 만나 꼭
의미없는 낙서를
담벼락에 새기듯
무의미하게 스쳐만 가는 얘기들
내가 태그된 글
실없는 웃음뿐인 영상이나 사진
정해진 답인양 대꾸해
늘 몇 개의 키읔 자로
웃어넘기는 척 하지
이유도 모른 채 닳아진 마음
이런 날 알아 주길 바라지만
답 없는 문제로 고민하는
내가 애 같아서
내 마음처럼 그냥 화면을 잠갔어
붕 또 이렇게 난 떠올라
부푼 외로움에 실려가는 대로
쿵 떨어지게 돼도 몰라
터진 눈물이 흘러가는 대로
모처럼 친구들을 만났어
취하면 좀 나아질까 봐서
반 억지로 채워낸 술 한 잔이지만
가볍게 비워내기엔
생각이 무겁지 난
익숙한 농담 몇 잔의 마취제
한바탕 요란했던 자릴 마친 뒤에
집으로 돌아오는 길
술 덕에 무뎌진 감정이
다시 쏠려와 난 구역질
혼자 뒤척이다
게워냈음 했던 너의 기억이 나
술기운을 빌려서 연락했지
나처럼 너도 괜찮은 척 하겠지
잘 지냈냔 너의 문자에
망설여 한참
그럭저럭 잘 지어낸
잘 지낸단 답장
응 시간 날 때 한 번 만나자
시간이 늦었네 그럼 잘 자
붕 또 이렇게 난 떠올라
부푼 외로움에 실려가는 대로
쿵 떨어지게 돼도 몰라
터진 눈물이 흘러가는 대로
날 가득 채우는 게 허전함이어서
날 비워낼래도 허전함만 컸어
혼자이기 싫어 뱉은
혼자이고 싶단 말
내 거짓말이 나만 못 속이나 봐
홀로 남은 듯한 소외감은
우리의 우주가 달라서일까
붕 중력을 모른다는 듯
새까만 밤을 혼자 표류하는 중

Give me a chance

and when is your time?
That is your time, Oh-Woah
Dreams like this take time
and when is your time?
That is your time, Oh-Woah

Seems like everyone knows how
to exist to please the crowds
When will I be the next thing?

for it to be my time

What do I call myself?

Tell me what I have left
Where do I fall?
Who do you call when you don't know yourself?

running two opposite ways

catch me now me now

drag me down me down

I feel the burden now
It's weighing down my soul

Not sure if anything is real

끝까지 난 애새끼지 뭐
또 네 앞에선 그렇게 티는 안내도
너도 알고 있단 거를 내가 알아
혼자서 집에 오는 길에 눈엔 눈물이
그래 이런 건 말 안 하지 나의 성격엔
끝까지 네 앞에선 쿨해야 해
너를 위해서 보내주는 거기에
아무리 슬퍼도 우리사인
오늘이 지나면 걍 모르는 사이로
그래 우리 오늘이 지나면
지나가자 모르는 사이로
그래 오늘이 지나면
지나가자 못 본 척을 하면서
그냥 오늘이 지나면
처음으로 돌아가는 거라고 생각해
그냥 오늘이 지나면
처음으로 돌아가는 거라고 생각해
우리가 왜 이렇게 됐는지에 대해서
넌 자꾸 모른다고 하지 그래 넌 최선의
답안이라 생각하며 피해가 계속
너와 나 서로 피해가기 바쁘지 매번
우린 항상 그런식이었어
넌 자꾸 피하고서 내게 돌려 잘못
모든 문제의 원인이 거기 다 있는데
너와 같이 보던 영화 속에선
주인공은 사랑을 이뤘어
영화 같지 않지 우리는 왜
넌 또 모르겠지
그래 우리 오늘이 지나면
지나가자 모르는 사이로
그래 오늘이 지나면
지나가자 못 본 척을 하면서
그냥 오늘이 지나면
처음으로 돌아가는 거라고 생각해
그냥 오늘이 지나면
처음으로 돌아가는 거라고 생각해

I'll just run away and be on my own

Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time

This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move

My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack, intends to show love

I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints I guess that god knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

I used to go run out the door
be on my way
But I lose control
when you got
your hands all on me
Could you love me so
'cause you might
take me out the game
Turning my phone drop everything
Got me changing my plans
and my focus
Friends wanna know just
what the hell happened to me
Well I've just been
lost in your eyes
those stars
and them candy lips
that I love for real
I might let you fuck my life up

I'm no good now
Ooh you're changing how I feel

확실하게 해야겠어 이제 그만
사실 5월이면
좀 급해 보일까 해서
다음 6월이면
바쁠 게 불 보듯 뻔해서
그러다 여기까지 왔어
친구인 티는 다 벗었어
You already know
흠 그러니까 내 말은
You're fine
I'm fine
And July
Oh 이유는 충분하잖아 BABY
You're fine
I'm fine
And July oh you know
난 남자일 때가 더 괜찮아

Oh lover
why you got me clobbered
Frustrated and bothered
Paranoid that
you’ll destroy my colour
And paint it cover it and fade it
Leave me looking jaded
Why do I still love you
when I hate this
Got me keeping quiet
But you know I wanna talk about it
I don’t wanna have to hide it
I need somebody to confide in
Don’t let me stow it away
‘Cause I can barely fight it
It’s a constant ache
when i’m reminded that
You never call my telephone
But you know we’re both alone
What is it you’re holding on to
Because there is something wrong
I understand that
you may never want me close
But understand that
I need you the most
I spread my love
Along your path so
Please tread softly
Please tell me
you won’t go stomping harshly
You don’t have to want me
But please tread softly
Softly
Softly
Softly
softly
Oh karma
Why do I even bother
When you never wanna stick with me
Instead of choosing others to favour
You know I can’t hate her
For watching him go chase her
When nothing
he could do could ever phase her
Got me sick and tired
Of the sneaking and the lying
But god knows that i’m trying to stay
But she’s denying that
she ever fell in love
With the pages of his mind
But she didn’t wanna
be in his cages all the time
Forgive me if you find me
replaying it in my head
You saying what you said
Words I wish I never read
‘Cause I
I
I need you the most
I spread my love
Along your path so
Please tread softly
Please tell me
you won’t go stomping harshly
You don’t have to want me
But please tread softly
Softly
Softly
Softly
Softly yeah yeah
Oh no uh oh no uh oh no uh
Just please tread softly
Oh no uh oh no uh oh no uh
Please tread softly
I need you the most
I spread my love
Along your path so
Please tread softly

held by you
I cannot control myself

이별이 무딘 것 만큼 슬픈 건
고갈되어버린 사랑과 순수함을
인정하는 것 만큼 슬픈 건 없다는 걸
마음이 아프죠
아니 어쩌면 아무런
아픔도 느끼지 못해서 아픈거죠
수혈을 받듯 과거의 기억에 기대어서
그대를 기다리는 난 비현실에 있어
같은 시간 속 같은 감정의
소용돌이 속에 우리 함께 있다면
같은 먹구름이 머리 위에 있다면
그대 이거 하나만 기억해주어요
지금 이 노랜 슬픈 노래가 아니에요
우울함은 창 밖으로 날려 보내요
그리움의 손을 잡고 춤을 추어요
잠시 왔다 가는 그런 시간인거죠
그대 슬퍼말아요
하루종일 비가 쏟아지네요
갇혀있는 듯이 방에 있네요

이별이 아름다울 리가
앓는 소리하기 바빴던
나는 너의 아픔까진 미처 못봤다
잘 지내 행복하길 바란다는 말은 이제
할 필요도 없어 오히려 짐이 돼
그녈 괴롭히는 말일 뿐인데
내가 뭘 할 수 있는데
어쩌면 너를 생각하는 일도
더이상 내가 해야하는 일이 아닐 지도
너를 위한 이별이란 위선
현실이란 핑계로 도망친 겁쟁이일뿐
너의 밤은 이제 온전히 너의 것이야
너의 방에 놓인 자그마한 오브제보다
가치가 없어진 나란 존재는 그저 혼자
최대한 고요히 네게서 지워지고파

아프게 하는 이들도 또한 아퍼
마음 안에 커다란 바위가 있는데
속 깊은 얘기들은 그 아래 깔려있어
답 안 나와 손에 쥔 열쇠 뭉치들로는
물음들을 활짝 열 수 있는 문이 없어
너나 나나 각자의 공간 안에 숨어서
인생을 중립 기어로 사는 기분이 들어
매일 넘어서야 하고
누군 넘어져야 하는
잔인한 이곳조차 이제 부서져가
성공학 옆에 진열된 행복에 관한 책
행복을 이루기보단 느끼고 싶어 그냥
시멘트색 눈빛과 늘어나는 허세
그 껍질 속엔 외로워
힘들다는 절박한 암구호
환멸 대신 모든 걸 환영할 때가 되면
일어날게 그땐 미소로 바라봐주오

빛은 언젠가는 새어 들어와
아픈 곳은 괜찮아질 거야

Get well soon
감기처럼 증오가 번져
우린 기침하듯 서로에게 돌을 던져
다름은 틀림이 되고 그렇게 적 져
너무나 아파 I need a bumper
반으로 찢겨 점점 벌어지는 정서
쉿 눈치 보는 중 내 목소리는 정적
안 튀게 조심해 삐끗하면 멍석
말이 no mercy 없어 이해와 용서
백신도 치료제도 아냐 종교와 정치는
분쟁의 도화선 혐오를 부추기는 화약
우릴 갈라 전쟁터로 떠밀 뿐
그래 너와 난 달라
우린 그걸 이해 못 해서 아파
서로의 입장 그 양 끝에 서선
절대 손을 못 잡아
가운데서 만나
밤이 오는 걸 막을 순 없어
빛은 언젠가는 새어 들어와
아픈 곳은 괜찮아질 거야
반드시 새살은 피어나
Get well soon
Get well soon
내가 말할 때는 쳐다봐줘 나의 눈
미리 증오치 말아 증명될 엄마의 꿈
진심과는 상반돼 오해를 사는 말투
좀 헷갈려 상처와 성찰 그 사이쯤에서
갈팡질팡하다 깨어나 버린 긴 잠
가끔 눈칠 봐 긴장된 심장
너가 내 심판이 되려고 할 때
이미 그 마음에서 내 진심은
쳐다보려고도 안 해
거짓이 진실이 될 때
필요한 건 이구동성
다수에게 묻혔네 한 사람의 목청
데시벨이 클수록 오답은 답 가까이
이제 우리가 서로를 그만 탓하게
사람 향기 나게 대화하자 한 번쯤
참던 숨을 내쉬어
이제 종교를 믿지 않거든
오해 마 나는 그저 진리를 따를 뿐
그 끝에 사랑이 위치한 곳으로 가는 중
밤이 오는 걸 막을 순 없어
빛은 언젠가는 새어 들어와
아픈 곳은 괜찮아질 거야
반드시 새살은 피어나

텅 빈 하루를 살아 난
나이는 적지 않아
가끔씩 궁금해져
어딜 향해 달려 넌
끝도 없이 밟아 왜
아직 뭔가를 찾는 너와 나
한심하다는 건 절대 아냐
why you keep on fallin
괜히 고민을 하는 나
아직도 우린 너무 몰라 yeah
why we keep on falling down
굳이 먼 길로 돌아가냐 왜
아직도 우린 몰라 왜
I just wanna know
why we keep on trippin'
cause when we do it for love
뜨거운 눈물을 흘려
but never travel alone
높은 언덕을 넘어 점점 멀리
we do it for love
do it for love
거짓말처럼
저마다의 고민들은 많지만
그런대로 살아가고 있는걸
어디쯤인지는 모르겠지만
앞으로만은 가고 있는걸
I just wanna know why I'm here
친구들에게 물어봐도
they don't know
아무리 물어봐도
결국에 답을 아는 건 나
why keep on losing my way
사소한 고민 걱정도
아마도 시간 지나면 다
why keep on falling down
사서 고생을 하냐 넌
이제야 알 것 같아 난
that's when we do it for love
cause when we do It for love
뜨거운 눈물을 흘려
but never travel alone
높은 언덕을 넘어 점점 멀리
we do it for love
do it for love
거짓말처럼
cause when we do it for love
뜨거운 눈물을 흘려
but never travel alone
높은 언덕을 넘어 점점 멀리
we do it for love

안 하던 짓까지 나도 나름 꽤 바뻐
Please help me 야 너가 나 좀 살려
줬음 좋겠어 니가 한 말까지도
책임질 수 있어 너 아직도
그렇게 행동하는데 난 까짓거
쿨하게 행동하려는데 yeah yeah
너가 만난 모든 나쁜 남자보단
내가 너를 많이 아끼고 있단 말야
너의 맘은 닫혀 닮아간단 말야
너가 싫어하던 나쁜 놈의 것들이랑
근데 이미 빠져 나는 모든 것에
자꾸 안 하려고 해도 너의 생각 절대
멈출 수가 없단 말야 너의 모든걸
느끼고 싶어
Baby I love u girl yeah
너는 내 모든 것 But
나는 네 삶에 없어
너의 맘 속에 가긴 어려워 너무 어려워
너의 몇 번째 인진 몰라
너의 첫 번째 내가 떠올라
너가 처음 느껴보는 감정 싹 다
Love 이라고
Love with me yeah eh
난 너의 몇 번째일지
지나왔던 모든 건 다 해봤겠지
하지만 진짜 마음은
느껴본 적이 없을 거야

너를 위해 난 더욱 나은
남자가 되고 있어 도망

너는 너무 인싸 그래 나도 네게 빠져
넌 친구들도 많고 나는 그냥 짜져
너의 전 남친은 진짜 삐까뻔쩍하고
멋진 것도 많이 해봤겠지 나는 아녀
나는 니가 첨이라고 이런 감정 알어
차라리 못 느껴봤음 싶어 너도라면
덜 열등감을 느끼겠지 같은 맘이라면
그래 이게 첫사랑임 좀더 아늑할 걸
근데 너는 많은 경험 해봤잖아 더
그게 싫어 나는 오직 널
바라보고 있는데 네 웃는 얼굴
다른 사람 품속에서
떠올라
미안 나는 찌질해서
너가 다른 사람 만나는 게 싫어
과거를 돌릴 수는 없지만
그것도 포함해서 싫어
yeah yeah
너는 내 모든것 But
나는 네 삶에 없어
너의 맘 속에 가긴 어려워 너무 어려워
너의 몇 번째 인진 몰라

and i know it
그런 네가 좋아
때론 낯선듯한 너의 모습에
조금은 어색하게 행동할지 몰라
원래부터 그런 성격은 아냐
나도 모르게 따라가게 돼
찡찡대는 너의 모습 까지다
전부다 네가 좋아
i fell in love 같을 순 없을까
너도 나와 같은 맘였으면 해
i got a love 말 건네고 싶게 해
너의 그 aura 빠져들어 aura
우린 같으면서도 조금 달라
가끔 널 들여다보는 상상을 해
너의 의미 없는
그 말들에 생각이 많아져
무튼 다 좋은데
어색할지 몰라
내 뜬금없는 말에 넌 웃어넘기며
아무렇지 않게 okay
아무리 애써봐도 최선을 다해봐도
she don’t give a she say to me
shut up
